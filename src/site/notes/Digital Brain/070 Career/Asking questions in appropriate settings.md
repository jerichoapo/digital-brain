This isn't exactly binary but it's a framework on when you should ask things 1:1 or in a group setting. When in doubt, follow your gut and then read the room. If you think you made a mistake, own up to it 

"Sorry I think I made a mistake, let's pin my question for now to not sidetrack our agenda. X, let's talk about this 1:1"

"Sorry X, I should've asked this in a group setting, I think others could've found the answer valuable. I'll share the context with them after our meeting."

Make the mistake and own up to it, then move on.
