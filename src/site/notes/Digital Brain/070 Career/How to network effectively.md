"Networking" what a terrible word. How about, getting to know other human beings. I guess that word is too long. A few things to think about when you're at an event where you're the new guy/gal.

1.) Treat everyone like they're important because they are.
- Imagine "make me feel important" on people's foreheads

2.) At conferences, read bios not sessions
- Look for interesting people
- Look at the moderator not just the panel
- "First time here... a little lost.. [X purpose]. Anyone where you think I should talk to that would be cool to meet?"

3.) Don't be a traffic bigot
- Don't go for the person w/ the biggest influence
- Find the up and comers, the pre-vip
- See if moderator is connected

4.) Picking people from the crowd:
- Go for the most relaxed and unrushed person
- Ice breakers
- Small talk is big talk, stop pitching
- Instead of what do you do, ask life questions:
- Where are you from?
- In person is a unique experience, meet the human being

5.) Ignorance is bliss, be the idiot
- 2 people, don't interrupt
- 3 or more, it's my first time
- Here by myself, don't know anyone, do you guys mind if I eaves drop?
- Ask "why"
- Identify people who are open minded and talk to them

6.) When finally talking to someone big
- Ask if they have a second "is now ok to ask X questions? / do you have 30 secs?"
- Who in your team can I talk to or email about?
- If they have an entourage, they are the gateway. talk to them
- Prove the messenger not the message

7.) Don't leave an impression, leave a memento
- "I know you're super busy... want to be respectful of your time. This is who I am and project I'm working on."
- Cater 1 pager for them with pitch and phone number
- I can also email this to you directly or your team, would you like me to do that?
