If you don't set a boundary, someone else will do it for you. Be the person that sets the tone.

Write down your expectations for accessibility, scope, and authority

Accessibility
- When and how is the company accessible to your time?

Scope
- What is within your job responsibilities and isn't?

Authority
- What decisions are you empowered to make?
- When do you need approval?
- When are others responsible for deciding?
