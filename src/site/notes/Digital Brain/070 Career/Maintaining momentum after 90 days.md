This is after the [[Digital Brain/070 Career/Listening tour\|Listening tour]]. Stay in touch with people.

Once a month, set a reminder to ask:
- Are there any coworkers or people in my network that I should check in on and reconnect with?
- How am I doing on my goals? 
	- Track progress on goals and realign them
- Are the right meetings on my calendar?
	- Which should be removed? who should I start having more touch points with?
- Do I know when the next performance conversation is?
	- Maybe there's an official time or there isn't one and you ask for one
- Am I sticking to the boundaries I set in this job?
	- Make sure they are reinforced before it becomes a point of no return
