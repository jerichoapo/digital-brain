My career is quite odd. I never followed a linear path academically and professionally. 

For a former undocumented immigrant who barely passed high school, I consider myself a success story. College was when things started to make sense and although I graduated late, I'm glad things played out the way it did because it allowed me to work various part-time jobs and be exposed to different scenarios and people.

My career is more of a result of my actions rather than me "actively pursuing a great career". I love to learn, I love to be challenged, I love the process of striving to be the best version of myself.
