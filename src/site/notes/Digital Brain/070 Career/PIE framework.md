Not sure where I got this from, I don't fully agree with it because I believe performance is half of the equation but performance can be defined as your image and presentation too. Anyways, a rough framework on building credibility at work.

PIE
- Performance = 10%
	- Share wins
	- Praise others
- Image = 30%
	- How you're perceived by the people who work with you
	- Build relationships with coworkers. find ways to work with them
- Exposure = 60%
	- People know what you've done
	- How it matters to the organization
