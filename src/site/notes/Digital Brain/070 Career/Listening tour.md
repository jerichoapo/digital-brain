Do this when you're new at a company. Talk to people, form connections, and be a sponge.

Who should you talk to?
- People you'll work closely with
- Who have key insights into parts of the business
- Anyone else impacted by your work

Schedule a meeting
- Hi [name], I recently started in the marketing department as the content marketing manager. [manager] mentioned I should meet you to discuss what you do generally and to get to know each other. Are you open to chatting for 30 minutes? I can find some open times on our calendars.

Goals for the meeting
- Connect personally!
	- What do they do in their free time?
	- Connect authentically as a human
- Understand what they're working on
	- What are your biggest projects and priorities?
	- Find one way to help them
		- Whether that's a reference (framework I've seen or used)
- Get helpful info for your role
- Who in the business do you think I should talk to?
