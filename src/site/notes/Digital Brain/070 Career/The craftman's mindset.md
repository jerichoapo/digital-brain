One of the best books I've ever read is So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport. I wish more people read this book before they try to climb the ladder and become an exec.

A powerful motivator in life isn't money. It's an opportunity to learn, grow in responsibilities, contribute to others, and recognition in achievements. Metric outcome shouldn't be how much money you've made but how you've positively changed other people's lives.

Remove the Passion Mindset
- Follow your passion is flawed

Develop the Craftsman's Mindset
- Focus on building career capital
- Experience, skills, expertise, etc.
- Think of how you can be a valuable person to an organization.
- Develop the skills you'll need to be successful at your "dream job"

1.) Decide what capital market you're in:
- Winner take all market
- Only one type of career capital available
- Lots of different people competing for it
- ex. acting

- Auction market
- Many different types of career capital
- Each person will provide a unique skillset
- ex. entrepreneur

- Marketing, sales, capital raising, leadership, etc.
- Seek open gates
- Opportunities to build capital that are already open to you
- ex. alumni networks, existing contacts

2.) Define "good"
- Set clear goals of:
	- What you're trying to get to
	- What you'd like to achieve
	- What skills you'll need

3.) Work
- Deliberate practice (deep work)
- If you show up and do what you're told then you'll reach a level of "acceptable"
- Aim high
- Seek feedback and constructive criticism

MOST IMPORTANT TIP:
Patience
- Acquiring capital takes time
- Remember your goals and reject shiny new pursuits (grit)
- 10,000 hours or ten year rule
