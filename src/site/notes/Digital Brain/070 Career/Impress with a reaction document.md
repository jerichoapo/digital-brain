Not sure where I got this note. I love options, bosses do too. But remember to make a recommendation too, it's your job to make it easy for them.

Let's say your boss says they need help putting together a retreat for the leadership team.

The mediocre employee would wait to be told what to do and how to do it. The good employee would come up with some probing questions to understand what needs to be done. They try to uncover what their boss will want, such as what are the goals of the retreat? How much time will it take? What kind of venue are you interested in?

But the favorite employee would create a reaction document. You know this meeting is coming up. So you reach out to some people in your network who have put on retreats in the past and get some information on how they are put together. You assemble that info into a reaction document.

Here's an example: "In this document there are three different ideas of retreats that there could be. Notice the information is brief and it talks about the outcomes, the context, and the estimated cost."

So that at a quick glance, their manager can take a look and get an immediate reaction about what might work best for them. 

There are so many more details that could have gone in here but for the sake of a reaction document, you want to make things more high level before jumping in deep. 

Your boss might say it's for sure not the first option but some crossover between the second and third option. 

They were able to react, not create. They will be grateful that you are proactive in coming up with solutions.
