- Explain and results
	- Likely more Q&A, questions on methodology, questions on data you don't have
	- Come prepared with common questions:
		- What action is this conversion based on?
		- Why don't the numbers match in the different platforms?
		- Can you explain that attribution model in a little more detail?
	- Tell an understandable data story, not too technical
	- Consider the limitations

		- Winning version of a A/B test
		- Previous audience targeting results

- Call to action
	- More ad-hoc situation like mid-campaign changes
	- Focused on a very specific subject
	- Can and should be more granular with the data
	- Should have a hypothesis and expected outcome to share
	- examples:
		- A competitor removed the android version of their app, if we move now we have the opportunity to increase market share
		- There was an interruption in web tracking due to a change on the site, we need resources to fix it as soon as possible
