Choosing the right type of visualization, placement, etc. 

Chart choice
- Choosing the best chart for the data may differ for presentations compared to dashboards or other data visualizations

Chart placements
- For complex = put visual on the right and text on the left so the the reader reads the copy, then analyzes the graph
- For results = put visual on the left and copy on the right for the explanation

Use progress charts for the agenda
- Kickoff > measurement strategy > launch > analysis and results

Divide slides in half for a callback
- Show data from previous slides to refer back to on the left + new data on the right

Attentive vs pre-attentive
- Aim for pre-attentive = you subconsciously recognize the meaning
- How easy do you make it for your audience to look at the most important elements?
	- Adding colors
	- Heatmaps
	- Bar charts

- Your goal is clarity
- Use data labels when possible
- Use screenshots from your dashboard

Credibility: Potential audience questions
- Which tools were used?
- What method did you use to get to that metric?
	- Bonus: show how you got to a conclusion based on the data
- Wow did you choose and the segmented audience
