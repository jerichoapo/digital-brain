If marketing is my first love, then I consider data to be the best friend I found after I grew apart from my childhood, teenage, and young adulthood best friends.

It's the mature best friend who doesn't necessarily tell me what to do, they give you sometimes subtle, sometimes obvious hints of what you need to pay attention to.

Anyone can be data literate. You don't need to love math, but it helps to understand statistical concepts. You don't need to be a master in excel, but it helps to know the basics. You don't need to know SQL, but it helps to understand how your data is organized.

My point is that data analytics, especially for someone like me who hated math in high school, is something that can be learned at a proficient level. Like anything in life, you need to put the time and effort in first before you see any results.

Thankfully, it's easier as ever to get access to marketing analytics. Whether that's GA4, HubSpot, PostHog, or other similar tools. 

The best marketers in my opinion are those who can tell a story with words *and* data. I think marketers often rely on the qualitative more than the quantitative, but the ones who get my respect are those who can also communicate in numbers.
