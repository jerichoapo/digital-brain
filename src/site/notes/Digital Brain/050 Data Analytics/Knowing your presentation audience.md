Number one rule in presentation is to know your audience
- Their goals
- How your analytics presentation serves that need

Audience check-in
- What they know about you and your job
- Reminder of the team's role, goals, challenges, opportunities

Be clear about what the purpose of the presentation is, plant the seed in everyone's mind to tie the data to the goals

Knowledge share
- Why a metric was chose or not chosen
- A small mention or footnote of what **analysis** tools were used creates more reference
- Based on the data, sharing **how** you came to your conclusion showcases your data-driven expertise

Prepping people for the meeting
- A simple what-to-expect list *before* the meeting
