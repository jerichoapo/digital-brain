Productive questions help ourselves and others take consistent, focused action on what is most valuable.

Principles
- Ask more than you tell
	- focus on exploration first before fixing. slow down on the advice giving and stay curious just a little longer
- let go of your ego
- be open to any outcome
	- respect the agency of others
- ask open-ended questions
- go several layers deep
- finish with action questions
	- what will we do next?
	- when will we do that?
	- how would you like me to help?

* good > bad
	* what do you think caused that mistake? > why did you make that mistake?
	* what caused this to happen? > this happened because
	* how can we improve? > this is how we improve
	* who should be involved in the decision-making? > talk to your supervisor
	* what tools do you think you'll need? > you'll need these tools
