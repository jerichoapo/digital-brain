		- "We ran this test for 14 days, which was longer than the original one week goal. It was a surprise to see that our result couldn't be statistically determined within one week because of what we've seen with your other campaigns. I'm thinking that this might be because the variants weren't different enough, our sample size might need to be bigger, or it may just truly be equally effective message as the original, which means we should move on to other tests with a goal of higher optimization."
