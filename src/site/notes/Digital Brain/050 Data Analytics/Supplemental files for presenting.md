Share as much info and context *before* a presentation

Examples of supporting the data
- Sharing the presentation file
	- Prevents: "Can you go back to the previous slide"
- Providing a related dashboard
- A message that summarizes the presentation beforehand

> "Narrative memos give authors the chance to fully communicate the thoughts behind their ideas, and give meeting participants the chance to better understand full concepts"
