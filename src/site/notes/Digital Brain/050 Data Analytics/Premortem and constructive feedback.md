A big part of knowing that you’re right is working as hard as you can to prove that you’re wrong. If you can’t prove that you’re wrong, there’s one option left: you’re probably right.

Postmortem
- Process to determine why a failure happened and what can be done to prevent it in the future
- The problem with this is that there has to be something wrong before there is action

Premortem
- Set up a thought experiment where we assume the project failed. we ask, "what went wrong?"
- Detects reasons for a future outcome
- Other benefits
	- Affirmatively ask people to generate reasons for failure
	- Create psychological safety

Getting feedback
- Ask people who normally agree with you to disagree with you
	- What's wrong?
	- What should be changed?
- If you can't find opposing voices, manufacture them
