Dashboards are for analysis, not a presentation asset 3 things to consider when presenting a chart or visualization.

- Material
	- Is the actual data (clicks, visits, conversion rates)
	- What you choose should be related to the [[Digital Brain/050 Data Analytics/Narrative formats\|Narrative formats]]
- Message
	- The actual metric
	- Great data doesn't always make the cut
	- If metrics don't help your argument or contribute to your purpose, the measurements may belong elsewhere and not in the presentation
- Meaning
	- What you expect the outcome to be if action is taken
	- Making sure the material and the message is interpreted correctly
	- "A 5-8% increase in new traffic is expected with a 2% lift in conversions"
