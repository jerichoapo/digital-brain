Framework for showcasing what you learned, what you propose/what you did, and it's impact

- Insight
- Action
- Impact

Insight:
- The primary insight is that the campaign could have been much more effective if the website was mobile friendly.
- The second insight was that the comparison to the industry average conversion rate, which was 0.75%.
- If this campaign ran at the industry average conversion rate, instead of a miserable 0.07%, it would have created over 2000 more leads with the lead value topping out at over $600,000 in potential revenue. 

Action:
- So what's the recommended action? You're the marketer, what should happen?
- This is where you shine and you present your solutions.
- In this case, you can make the rationalization for a new website and highlight the impact of an improved conversion rate. 
- Don't come in with a big long list of suggestions, focus on one to two major recommendations. 

Impact:
- What is the business or revenue impact of your recommendation? And this means you're speaking their language. 
- Here, you do the math. Don't use percentages, translate it to dollars and make it simple.
- First, show the baseline, this is where we are.
- Second, show the goal or the average that shows the opportunity.
- In this case, we can use the industry average and here's how it's presented. If we were just average, we would have increased our leads by over 2000. Monthly, that's a value of an additional $625,000.
- However, if we do nothing for the next three months, it's a loss of $1.8 million. And when you say it, just stop and let it sink in. They're going to have questions, but they'll understand what you've just dropped in their laps.
- And now we're real discussion can happen instead of debating the data points, now we're talking about we're losing money if we don't do anything.

You can always rely on the data that you have in reserve, the attention is now on you and your recommendations.

Use the framework of insight, action, and impact to translate data into executive language, financial language, and motivate them to action.
