AIDA is sales. Presenting is a sales opportunity, internally or externally.

AIDA
- Attention
	- Putting part of the conclusion first to give a glimpse into the most important part of the story
- Interest
	- Writing clear, universal language rather than niche terms
	- Use simple non-technical terms
		- Sessions -> site visits
		- OTT -> streaming platforms
- Desire
	- Writing clearly to the audience how the data benefits *them*, such as specific KPIs
- Action
	- A lot will be said verbally, but action items should always be in text

Transition between longer text and shorter (or no) text content to plan the flow of the presentation

Don't repeat the exact words on the presentation
