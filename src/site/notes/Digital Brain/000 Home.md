Hi, I'm Jericho. Welcome to my digital brain. A project to upload my thoughts and memories to the internet.

I built this because the human brain is great at creating ideas but it's terrible at remembering them. This is where I'll publicly document my notes and reflections on marketing, startups, life, and everything in between. 

My writing is imperfect whether that's typos, grammar, lack of formatting, etc. You'll notice different writing styles because some are old unedited notes or new incomplete notes. I'm also writing these in one sitting with little thought of editing. Some thoughts are my own while some are curated from various sources like courses, videos, podcasts, blogs, etc.

This website is a continuous work-in-progress. It's me working with the garage door open for anyone to come in and look around.

A little about me. I'm a dad, husband, and startup nerd. I'm passionate about building things whether that's media like this website or coding random stuff that's fun and/or useful to me.

Iâ€™m a human who loves to solve for *x*. 

*x* is defined as anything from:
- Startups = is an idea worth building in the first place?
- Growth = what experiments can we run in 2 weeks to learn if an idea has potential to be our next big thing?
- Marketing = how can we better understand the people we want to help so that we can find effective ways to reach and impact more of them?
- Technical = GA4, HubSpot, and PostHog broke and the latest Vercel build failed, what's the root cause of the problem?
- Content marketing = I want to transfer the knowledge in my brain into a website, how do I do that?
- Improvement = how can I be 1% better today?
- Life = my infant is crying and we've gone through the entire checklist twice, now what?

Ok enough about me. A few ways of navigating my digital brain:
- Traditional = table of contents
- Practical = search function
- Linear = [[Digital Brain/001 Life Timeline\|001 Life Timeline]]
- Experimental = maps of content (MOC)

I recommend getting started with maps of content below. Like a neural network, I'm using this to visualize how my thoughts are connected. 

- [[Digital Brain/010 Marketing/010 Marketing MOC\|010 Marketing MOC]]
- [[Digital Brain/020 Product/020 Product MOC\|020 Product MOC]]
- [[Digital Brain/030 Leadership/030 Leadership MOC\|030 Leadership MOC]]
- [[Digital Brain/040 Management/040 Management MOC\|040 Management MOC]]
- [[Digital Brain/050 Data Analytics/050 Data Analytics MOC\|050 Data Analytics MOC]]
- [[Digital Brain/060 Technical/060 Technical MOC\|060 Technical MOC]]
	- [[Digital Brain/060 Technical/060.1 Prompt Engineering/060.1 Prompt Engineering MOC\|060.1 Prompt Engineering MOC]]
	- [[Digital Brain/060 Technical/060.2 Python/060.2 Python MOC\|060.2 Python MOC]]
	- [[Digital Brain/060 Technical/060.3 SQL/060.3 SQL MOC\|060.3 SQL MOC]]
- [[Digital Brain/070 Career/070 Career MOC\|070 Career MOC]]
- [[Digital Brain/080 Journal/080 Journal MOC\|080 Journal MOC]]

This will be an evolving project as I continue to add notes, make new connections, and figure out what makes sense.
