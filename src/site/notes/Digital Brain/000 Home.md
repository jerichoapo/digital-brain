Hi, I'm Jericho. Welcome to my digital brain, I built this because the human brain is great at creating ideas and thoughts but it's terrible at remembering them.

This is where I'll publicly document my notes and reflections on marketing, startups, leadership, life, and everything in between. There's stuff here that I created based from my own experiences and some I curated from various sources like courses, videos, podcasts, blogs, and so on.

My writing is imperfect whether that's typos, grammar, lack of formatting, etc. You'll also notice different writing styles, that's because some are old notes that I haven't edited yet or new notes that are incomplete. This website is a continuous work-in-progress. It's me working with the garage door open for anyone to come in and look around.

A little about me. I'm a father, husband, and a startup growth marketer. I'm passionate about moving fast, building things, probably breaking that thing, then fixing it... or at least trying to. Iâ€™m a human who loves to solve for *x*.

*x* is defined as anything from:
- Business = is an idea worth building in the first place?
- Strategic marketing = how can we better understand the people we want to help so that we can find effective ways to reach more of them?
- Growth marketing = what experiments can we run in 2 weeks to learn if an idea has potential to be our next big thing?
- Technical marketing = GA4 and HubSpot broke and the latest Vercel build is failing too, what's the root cause of the problem?
- Improvement = how do I get 1% better today?
- Life = my infant is crying and we've gone through the entire checklist twice, now what?

A linear approach to navigate the website is through my [[Digital Brain/001 Life Timeline\|001 Life Timeline]]. A practical method is to use the table of contents or search function. 

I'm experimenting with maps of contents (MOC) to help visualize how my notes are connected, that'll be a long-term evolving project as I continue to add notes, form connections, and figure out what makes sense.
