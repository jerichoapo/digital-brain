The `lower()` function is a built-in Python string method that converts all the characters in a string to lowercase. It takes no arguments and returns a new string with all the letters in lowercase. 

Here is an example of how the `lower()` function works:

```python
text = "Hello World"
lower_text = text.lower()
print(lower_text)
```

In this example, the `lower()` function is called on the `text` variable, which contains the string "Hello World". The `lower()` function returns a new string with all the letters in lowercase, which is then stored in the `lower_text` variable. Finally, the `lower_text` variable is printed, and the output is:

```
hello world
```

Note that the original `text` variable is not modified by the `lower()` function, as strings in Python are immutable.
