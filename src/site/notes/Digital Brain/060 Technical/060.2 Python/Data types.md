In Python, there are several built-in data types that are used to define variables. Some of the common data types and their syntax are:

1. Integer: Integers are whole numbers that can be positive, negative, or zero. The syntax for declaring an integer variable is:

   ```python
   x = 10
   ```
   
2. Float: Floats are decimal numbers. The syntax for declaring a float variable is:

   ```python
   y = 3.14
   ```
   
3. Boolean: Booleans are true/false values. The syntax for declaring a boolean variable is:

   ```python
   a = True
   b = False
   ```
   
4. String: Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes. The syntax for declaring a string variable is:

   ```python
   name = "John"
   ```
   
5. List: Lists are ordered collections of items that can be of different data types. The syntax for declaring a list variable is:

   ```python
   mylist = [1, 2, "three", True]
   ```
   
6. Tuple: Tuples are similar to lists, but they are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once they are set. The syntax for declaring a tuple variable is:

   ```python
   mytuple = (1, 2, "three", True)
   ```
   
7. Dictionary: Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. The syntax for declaring a dictionary variable is:

   ```python
   mydict = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
   ```
