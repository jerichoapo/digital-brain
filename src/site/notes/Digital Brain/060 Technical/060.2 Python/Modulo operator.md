In Python, the % symbol is known as the modulo operator. It returns the remainder of the division between two numbers. For example, if you perform the operation 5 % 2 in Python, the result will be 1 because 5 divided by 2 is 2 with a remainder of 1. The syntax for the modulo operator in Python is `%`.
