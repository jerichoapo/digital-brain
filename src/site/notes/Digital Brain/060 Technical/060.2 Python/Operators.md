Python supports various operators that are used to perform different types of operations on operands. Here are the different types of operators in Python:

1. Arithmetic operators: used to perform mathematical operations on numeric operands. For example, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`, and `//`.

2. Comparison operators: used to compare the values of two operands. For example, `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`.

3. Logical operators: used to combine and manipulate boolean values. For example, `and`, `or`, and `not`.

4. Bitwise operators: used to perform bitwise operations on integer operands. For example, `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, and `>>`.

5. Assignment operators: used to assign a value to a variable. For example, `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=` , `**=`, `//=`.

6. Identity operators: used to compare the memory locations of two objects. For example, `is` and `is not`.

7. Membership operators: used to check if a value is a member of a sequence or not. For example, `in` and `not in`.
