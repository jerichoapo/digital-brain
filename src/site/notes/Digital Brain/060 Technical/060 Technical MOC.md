My side project. I learned Python and SQL to help me become more technical, but the biggest benefit of learning code for me has been human communication. I'm able to be much more accurate and specific with my communication. This has helped when explaining how things work or talking to devs. It's helped me think about better organizing my notes like this entire website.

I haven't used actual Python that much but I did use SQL to help me create dashboards on Metabase. Knowing the concepts of SQL helped me understand databases, tables, and joining tables.

I took the 100 Days of Code challenge to learn Python. Although I never finished, it was truly rewarding to figure out why my code wasn't working and then fixing it. Some of my fondest memories were sitting in front of my computer, watching the lectures, putting music on, and getting to work figuring out what I wanted to build from scratch. I don't have as much time as I do now to learn Python because it's not directly contributing to my actual marketing work, but I will definitely be back. Even 25 minutes a day of coding Python is better than 0 minutes.

Prompt Engineering is something I use almost on a daily basis. GenAI has been amazing in my daily life, it has almost replaced Google search for me.
