3 phases:
- Preparation
	- Know exactly what type of result you're after
	- Define the output first to ask the right questions
- Interaction
	- [[Digital Brain/060 Technical/060.1 Prompt Engineering/Prompt framework\|Prompt framework]]
	- Directing the conversation with more prompts until you get the output that you want
- Continuation
	- Adding the human element that AI can't create yet
	- Refining the words, critical thinking, etc
	- Testing for validity:
		- "Answer only using reliable sources and cite those sources"
		- Verify if factual because the model can still make up sources
		- If the model isn't connected to the internet, the response can be outdated
