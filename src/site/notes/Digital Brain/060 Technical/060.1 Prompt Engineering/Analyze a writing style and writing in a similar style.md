Analyze copy for tone of voice
- You are an expert linguist who is known for their ability to dissect the styles of writing. Please analyze the following copy for tone-of-voice.

Tell us who you think this copy has been written for. Finally, write a short paragraph with your analysis of the copy. Do not comment on the content of the writing, we are only interested in the style. The copy I want you to analyze is: "[TEXT]"
