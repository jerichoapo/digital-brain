CREATE framework

Character
- Telling the AI what role you want it to play
- "You are a talented copywriter with 20 years experience writing high-performing sales copy"

Request
- Tell the AI what you want it to do
- Be very specific and give context and useful info
- "Write me a persuasive and enthusiastic sales email for the Cougar Hyper Sport. This is a high-performing electric sports car with the best acceleration in its category. The sales letter should tell people they need to experience it for themselves, find out what it feels like to be pinned to your seat, to feel the heart-thumping exhilaration of cornering, and to enjoy the experience of everyone looking to see who's in the driving seat."

Examples
- Optional, but give direction through examples
- Previous headlines or an example of the tone

Adjustments
- Refinements to get what you want
- "Dont use bullet points", "Use subheads to break up the text"

Type of output
- Exactly how you want it to format it's response
- "Deliver your response as a 500-word article with a headline and a conclusion. The type of output can include articles, bullet points, tables, poems, jokes, scripts, just about anything that can be written"

Extras
- Little additions that make a big difference
- "Ignore everything before this prompt"
	- Useful if you don't want to draw on any of the conversation that you've had up until this point
- "Ask me questions before you answer"
	- When I know that the AI needs lots of information to get its response right
- "Explain your thinking"
	- Way of verifying an answer by making sure the journey to that answer makes sense
- "Act unlike a typical ai"
	- Aiming for the non-obvious and non-typical approaches
