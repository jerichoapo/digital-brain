Thankfully, I've been lucky enough to not have run into many difficult people in my professional career. But here's a framework of the types of difficult people and what to do

1.) Downers
- Complainers, negatives, gossip
- Sucks energy from the room

2.) Uppers
- Show offs, name droppers, one-uppers
- Low confidence, build themselves up    

3.) Passives
- No initiatives, no motivation
- Lacks confidence

4.) Tramplers
- Bossy, explosive, emotional
- Tramples over people

**What to do:**
- You can't fix them, only work with them and adjust your playing style
- Understand them and find their value language
- Ask open ended-questions to find what drives them

- **Keep perspective of their 'behind the scenes'**
- Be genuinely curious about their feelings, thoughts, and opinions

- **Stay calm**
- You don't need to be confrontational
- Detach yourself

- **Control yourself**
- Don't feed their fire
- Silence and calmness are your weapons
- Be the matador, not the bull

**The person who asks questions has control**
- Ask questions:
- Open ended
- Why, what, how

**Distance yourself**
- Minimize your interaction with them
- Be wary of chameleonization 

**Set boundaries**
- What to talk about
- Who to include in meetings
- Where to host meetings

Do away with the victim perspective
