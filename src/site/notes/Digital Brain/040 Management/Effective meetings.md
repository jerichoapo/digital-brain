One of the fastest ways to gain my respect is running an efficient and productive meeting. I strive to be one of those people. There's a time and place for the slower paced, personal meetings. A 2-minute hello in the beginning won't hurt either. But we all have things to do, let's jump into it.

Always have an agenda

Consider these 2 things:
- What is the purpose of the meeting?
- What outcome do you want from it?

Stick to the agenda.
- If it goes off topic, suggest that the conversation can be continued outside the meeting or in another meeting.

Keep meetings as short and concise as possible.

End every meeting with action items:
- What are the next steps?
- Who is responsible for them?
- What is the time frame?
