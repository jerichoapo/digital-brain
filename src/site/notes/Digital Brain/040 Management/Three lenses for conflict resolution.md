The idea is to use all 3 lenses when dealing with a conflict at work. I think the reverse lens is my favorite because I almost always assume that I'm wrong and work backwards to find the truth.

**Reverse lens**
- What would the other person in this conflict say and in what ways might that be true?

**Long lens**
- How will I most likely view this situation in 6 months?

**Wide lens**
- Regardless of the outcome of this issue, how can I grow and learn from it?
