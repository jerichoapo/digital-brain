GPT notes from the book, Great at Work:

1. **Do Less, Then Obsess**: Focus on a few key priorities and dedicate your efforts to excel in those areas. Spreading yourself too thin dilutes your effectiveness. It’s about going all in on what really matters.
    
2. **Redefine Your Work Value**: Value is not just the hours you put in but the value you produce. It's about how you contribute to your organization's outcomes with the quality and relevance of your work.
    
3. **P-Squared (Passion and Purpose)**: Passion for your work is important, but coupling it with a sense that your work has a meaningful purpose can lead to higher performance. Find what makes you passionate and how it serves a purpose beyond yourself.
    
4. **Forceful Champions**: Be a forceful advocate for your work. It's not enough to have good ideas; you must push them forward, gain support, and overcome resistance.
    
5. **Fight and Unite**: Engage in heated, constructive debates to challenge ideas and assumptions but unite behind decisions once they’re made. This approach leads to better outcomes and stronger team cohesion.
    
6. **Disciplined Collaboration**: Collaborate only when it adds real value. More collaboration isn't always better; it must be focused, disciplined, and purpose-driven.
    
7. **Learn from Feedback**: Use feedback as a tool for improvement. Seek it actively, listen to it carefully, and apply it constructively.
    
8. **The Power of Small Wins**: Break down large goals into smaller, manageable tasks. Celebrate the small victories to maintain motivation and progress.
    
9. **Innovation Not Instant Perfection**: Embrace experimentation and learning from failures. Innovation comes from trying new things, not from getting it perfect the first time.
    
10. **The 7-Hour Sleep Rule**: Contrary to glorifying overwork, the book emphasizes the importance of rest, particularly getting at least 7 hours of sleep, to maintain high performance.
