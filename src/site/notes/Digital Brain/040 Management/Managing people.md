A collection of notes from various books, podcasts, and videos. Managing people is hard and rewarding. I love it, but I admit that there are times it drains me. People are random and it's not always a binary solution. That said, there are guidelines to follow from some of the most successful and experienced managers and what I've personally learned.

Rule number 1: listen first, speak last.

Ask questions instead of suggesting answers.

Teach a person how to think instead of telling them what to think.

Listen to understand how the person feels and ask why.

See people as people first, employees second

Focus on the 20% high performers
- Don't spend too much time pushing a 60% employee to 100%
- Focus energy on the 85% employee and push them to 100%

If someone comes with a problem and you have a solution, get them to give you their solutions
- Walk through why those solutions are good/bad with them
- Ask open-ended questions
- build their self-thinking skills

If someone asks for help, feedback, assistance. Don't delay.
- At least respond that you're looking into it.

Create workflows and processes to make everyone's role easier
- Create SOP to automate training and staff turnover

Focus on making your entire team succeed
- When they succeed, you succeed

Be approachable and engage your team
- Open door policy but when the door is closed for deep work, it's closed
- Get a pulse on them by asking questions.

Practice confidence and humility
- If your attitude is that only people higher in rank have something to teach you, your learning opportunities will be limited
- This applies to life as well, CEO or homeless person
- Have the humble eagerness to learn something from everyone and your learning opportunities will be unlimited
