Management can be some of the most rewarding and excruciating experiences as a professional. There are frameworks and systems that talk about how to manage people, some of which I found helpful and have listed here.

The big thing I've learned with managing people is that we are humans. Humans are random and unpredictable. Humans behave in ways we can't control, even if we do or say the right things.

No matter how bulletproof your system or framework is, the variable of human randomness makes things very difficult to predict.

What I've found works for me is to peel it back to the human level. This is a human being with aspirations and fears. A person with a life and family outside of work; and if they're committed employees they'll be thinking and perhaps stressing about work. Which *can* be good because it shows they care.

With all that in mind, what can you do to serve them to achieve their goals? What can you do to alleviate their fears? What can you do to show that you're both on the same team (even if you have opposing opinions), but you both want this team to win?
