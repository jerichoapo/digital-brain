This might be one of my favorite sections. This is a true test of creativity because this is when you do things that aren't taught in school. It's getting scrappy, bold, and a little bit rebellious.

Some ideas on turning heads and winning hearts without needing to sell your intern's kidney:

### Stunts

I'm talking about those jaw-dropping, "Did they really just do that?" moments. It could be projecting your logo on the side of a building, a flash mob in the city center, or something as simple as sidewalk chalk art that leads people right to your doorstep (virtual or physical). The goal is to create buzz in a WTH was that? (in a good way) Make something so interesting that people can't help but snap a pic and share it with their friends.

### User-generated contests (case study)

My first job was selling frozen yogurt. This one kid, Tucker, would pile his cup with so much froyo it looked like a leaning tower of nasty. He was proud of his work and he'd bring his friends along and they'd all share. It was fun. 

One day I took a picture of him and his friends with their massive creation. Printed it out, wrote the weight and cost, and stuck it on our wall next to the cash register. Next thing you know, more kids were doing this trying to beat the last record and we'd take a picture of every attempt and winner and post it on our wall of fame.

It turned into a little local competition, who could fit the most froyo in our cup? 

It was hilarious. It was disgusting. It was good for business.

The lesson is to get your users in on the action in a fun way. It doesn't need to be a financial incentive, in this case, our customers were paying more money for participating in the contest! The prize was to get on the wall. Get creative!

### Partner with the unexpected

Partnerships can be gold, but let's skip the usual suspects. Partner with a local artist for a mural that incorporates your branding, team up with a food truck to create a special dish named after your product, or collab with an up and coming DJ to drop mentions of your startup between tracks at a popular club or event. 

### Go where your audience is

Guerilla marketing is all about context. Go where your audience is, but do it in a way that they’d never expect. If your audience is college students, why not sponsor a study break during finals week with free coffee branded with your logo? 

ind the places your competitors haven’t even thought to look. Think bathroom stalls, the bottom of coffee cups, or even a temporary tattoo on a bald guy's head. It's about placing your message where it’s least expected but where it'll definitely be seen.

### The possibilities are endless

Guerilla marketing is about thinking outside the box -- way way way outside the box. When you're in the early stages of a startup you have a lot less to lose and can be highly risk averse. So swing with everything you've got, the umpire isn't watching.
