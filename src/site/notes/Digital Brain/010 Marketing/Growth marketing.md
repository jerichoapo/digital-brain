###  What growth marketing is

Growth marketing is about rolling up your sleeves and diving deep into the data to find out what truly moves the needle. 

It's not about throwing money at ads and hoping for the best. It's about being scrappy, testing relentlessly, and using insights to drive decisions. 

Growth marketing is about understanding your customer so well that you can anticipate their needs, solve their problems, and deliver value that keeps them coming back for more. 

It's about leveraging every touchpoint, from social media to email to your product itself that your product experience feels like meeting a person that you really click with.

### What growth marketing isn't

Growth marketing isn't a magic bullet. 

It's not about chasing the latest hack or trend. Forget about vanity metrics that look good on paper but don't actually contribute to your bottom line. It's not about spamming your audience with irrelevant messages or being everywhere at once without a clear strategy. It's not about doing things because "that's how it's always been done."

### **Ok so what's the difference Between Traditional and Growth Marketing?**

Don't get me wrong, traditional marketing still works. Especially if you're a huge conglomerate like Coca-Cola or Disney. If you're them, first of all, what are you doing reading this playbook? But also, if you are them, you're fighting fire with fire. Fire defined as the traditional marketing your competitors are using.

So with traditional marketing, think billboards, TV commercials, and print ads. It's about casting a net so far and wide that you catch anything and everything. It's brand awareness on a massive scale.

The problem with this is that if you're a startup, it's a bit like yelling into a void and hoping someone yells back. It's also slow vs. growth marketing. Let's use a print ad on a magazine for example. (Do people still read these things?)

We have to identify where to place the print ad. Contact people. Learn about their readership demo. How much it costs. Design the thing. Send them the design. Get it approved. Figure out when the next print ad is. It gets printed. People buy it or is shipped the thing. They read it... or it sits on their kitchen counter for awhile. Then they flip through the pages and you're hoping they see your ad, etc. you get the point. It takes forever and don't get me started on attribution.

Now compare that to editing a template on from Canva or shooting a 10 second video, pushing it through Meta ads, and clicking a few buttons to hyperfocus on who to show your ads to (or let the algorithm do it's thing).

This is a matter of your people seeing your marketing in a few hours vs days or weeks.

That's what growth marketing is. It's where you trade in your megaphone for a laser pointer. It's not just about getting your name out there, it's about strategic and targeted efforts that drive specific actions. 

Ads are just one example but it also covers social media, SEO, content marketing, email campaigns, and even guerilla marketing. It's a smaller scale, but it's often cheaper and will give you faster learnings. And at the early startup stage, the speed to learn is priced higher than gold.
