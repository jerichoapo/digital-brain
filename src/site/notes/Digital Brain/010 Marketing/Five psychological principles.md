Marketing is psychology and sociology. A few behavioral concepts to guide you in being a better science-based marketer.

**1. Halo Effect**

What it is: _The tendency to attribute positive qualities to someone (or a brand) based on a favorable first impression or single positive trait._

Example: Patagonia is known for its commitment to sustainability, ethical manufacturing, and corporate social responsibility. So consumers feel good about shopping there, since they believe they're supporting a brand that contributes to the greater good.

**2. Primacy Effect**

What it is: _People are more likely to remember and give greater importance to information at the beginning of a sequence._

Example: When a salesperson starts their pitch with a product's most impressive benefits, that info is what's top of mind for customers.

**3. Negativity Bias**

What it is: _The tendency to give more weight to negative experiences than positive ones, leading to pessimism and risk aversion._

Example: A cybersecurity firm talks about the horrors of being hacked in one ad, and the cozy feeling of security in another. According to the negativity bias, the first ad would leave a stronger impression.

**4. Framing Effect**

What it is: _People's decisions and perceptions are influenced by the way information is presented to them._

Example: A subscription-based service highlights the cost per day instead of the monthly price, making it seem more affordable.

**5.** **Priming Effect**

What: _Exposure to a stimulus influences a person's thoughts, feelings, or behaviors in response to a subsequent, related stimulus._

Example: A nonprofit uses emotionally charged language and images in their fundraising campaign, eliciting empathy and increasing the likelihood of donations.
