Think about the brands you love. I'm willing to bet my Charizard card signed by Charizard himself that they have a great content marketing strategy. 

What exactly is "content"? It's a broad term but it's any asset that you consume. So think: social posts, graphics, videos, podcasts, blogs, ebooks, even videos from the founder is content.

It's both the format and language that you use to communicate to your audience.

### Advantages

Content marketing lets you punch way above your weight class. People follow people and content is a way for your startup to not be a faceless brand. It gives you the opportunity to give your startup a voice.

It also has a longer shelf-life vs other formats like paid ads. With ads, the moment you stop paying, you stop getting visibility. With a blog post or a video, you can keep attracting eyeballs and building trust indefinitely.

The goal with content isn't pure conversion. It's a long-term play where you plant a seed that can be a huge tree and pillar of growth in the future. There's also an opportunity to continue repurposing your original posts.

Imagine this: Write a script for a video and turn shoot that video. Now convert that script into a blog post. Turn the blog post into a small snippet and send it in an email or include it in a newsletter directing to the blog and/or video. Slice your videos up into clips and post those on social. Grab the audio from the video, edit it, and put it up as a podcast. Now in the podcast description, link to your blog post. 

The possibilities go on. Do it over and over again and you've created fragmented pieces of content from one anchor content.

### Disadvantages

Content marketing isn’t all sunshine and rainbows. There are some real challenges, especially for startups that are all about moving fast and needing results yesterday.

First off, speed to results is slow. Content marketing is a long game. You’ve got to be in it for the haul, which can be tough when you’re itching for immediate wins.

Clear attribution is also a pain point. In a perfect world, every content you create leads straight to a sign-up or purchase. But the real world is messy. Humans are random and the world is getting stricter with data privacy.

For content marketing to work, you need to align on the goal that this is a long-term play which means you'll need to incorporate other short-mid term plays like guerilla marketing in the early days, paid ads, partnerships, and more.

### Building an MVP content machine

So, how do we tackle this beast? Treat it like a startup and build an MVP content machine that’s lean and designed to scale:

1. **Strategy first.** What’s the goal? Traffic? Engagement? Follows? Define what winning looks like for you in the first few weeks, months, and quarters. As much as vanity metrics like shares, followers, comments, etc. don't matter. It matters in the early stages as you're getting a feel for what resonates with your audience.
2. **Know your audience.** Speaking of your audience, refer back to your ICP research. Get into your audience's head. What do they need? What keeps them up at night? Talk about those things like you're a trusted friend with a whole lot of wisdom.
3. **Create.** Put your head down and create. Make every piece of content count. Educate. Entertain. Edutain. If it doesn’t serve a purpose, scrap it. It's easy enough today to fire up Canva and create graphics. It's easy enough to ask ChatGPT to help you brainstorm content ideas. Sit down (or stand), and create content.
4. **Play to your strengths.** Are you a wordsmith? Great on camera? A voice for radio? Use what you’re good at to create content that stands out. And if none of these are you, remember everything I said in the last bullet where everything is easier today. It's also easy and relatively affordable to hire someone on a contract to create all these things for you.
5. **Distribute, repurpose, and distribute again.** Don’t just hit publish once and call it done. Repurpose your content into multiple pieces of different types of content and share it again. Also don't be afraid to literally repost content you've already shared. Chances are, only a small portion of your followers saw your first content.
6. **Measure, learn, repeat.** Refer back to the goal. Keep an eye on what works and what flops. Repost it again to see if it does flop. It's all an experiment and you need as big of a sample size as you can get. Use that intel to do more of the good stuff and less of the rest.
