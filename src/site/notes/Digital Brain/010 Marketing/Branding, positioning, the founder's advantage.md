If data is the brains of your startup, then your story is the heart. When people say they fall in love with a brand, it's a mix of both the genius of the product and the story behind it. You need both.

This isn’t just about what you sell, it’s about why you exist in the first place. It's the narrative that connects you to your audience on a human level. It’s what separates the memorable from the forgettable.

### Brand story framework

Your brand story isn’t a bullet list of product features or company milestones. It’s the tale of why you do the things you do. It’s about the problem you saw that no one else was solving—the dragon you decided to slay. This story should weave through everything you do, from your website to your packaging, your social media, even the way you answer emails. 

1. Start with the why
Why does your brand exist? Dig deep. What’s the fire that got this whole thing started? That's your cornerstone.

2. Identify the dragon you're slaying
Every epic tale has a dragon. What’s the big, bad problem in the world that your brand is here to tackle? Make it clear, make it relatable, and most importantly, make it something people want to see defeated.

3. Chart the Journey
Share the adventure of how your brand came to be. Where did you start, what challenges did you face, and how did you overcome them? This is where the founder's advantage comes into play. Be raw, be real.

4. Showcase the treasure
Here’s where you reveal the treasure you’ve brought back from your quest. How does your product or service make your customers' lives better? What makes it unique? This isn’t about features; it’s about benefits and transformation.

5. Introduce the fellowship
Every hero has a fellowship, a band of loyal allies. Highlight your team, your culture, and how your community (customers) plays a role in your ongoing story. This builds connection and relatability.

6. Call to Adventure (Your CTA)
Every great story invites others to join the journey. What’s your call to adventure for your audience? How can they get involved? Make it inspiring, make it actionable.

7. Paint the Vision of the New World
End with the vision of the future your brand is creating. How is the world better with your brand in it? This is your “happily ever after” that leaves people inspired and wanting to be part of the story.

### Positioning framework

Positioning is two sides of the same coin as brand story. I'd argue it's on the same side, just different locations. Positioning is getting super specific about your product. Is your unique differentiator clear? Here's a simple framework:

1. Your product's superpowers.
Think about all the unique benefits your product offers, like saving time, reducing costs, automating tasks, etc.. These aren't just features, they're the pillars of the unique value your product brings to the table.

2. The competitive landscape
Understanding your competition is crucial. If everyone is boasting about a common feature, it’s your job to find what makes your offering stand out. A simple way of doing this is creating a comparison section or page on your website.

3. Customer's needs and desires
This step is all about empathy and connection. Understand the problems they face daily, the solutions they seek, their aspirations, and their frustrations with current offerings. It’s these insights that will guide you in positioning your product in a way that resonates deeply with them.

### Leveraging the founder's advantage

As a founder, you’ve got a unique superpower—authenticity. You’re not some faceless corporation; you’re a real person who took a leap based on a belief. That’s gold. Use it. When you share your journey, your struggles, and your wins, you’re not just building a brand; you’re building relationships. 

People connect with people. People buy from people. People buy from people... they like.

Your story, told from your heart, can turn customers into champions who believe in your mission as much as you do.

Your founder's story is your secret sauce. It’s what makes people sit up and listen in a world bombarded with marketing messages. Whether it’s through a heartfelt note in your packaging, a candid post on social media, or a tear-jerker “About Us” video, let the world see the passion behind the brand. Show them the person behind the product, and you’ll forge connections that last.

Putting your brand story, positioning and the founder's advantage together isn’t just marketing strategy, it’s leaving a legacy. It’s about making your mark in the hearts and minds of your audience, turning passive customers into passionate advocates. So go ahead and tell your story like only you can and watch as the world leans in to listen.
