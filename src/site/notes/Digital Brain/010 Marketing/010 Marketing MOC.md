I actually don't consider what I do to be "marketing", it's more like common sense. Marketing to me begins with a simple grounding question: Do I believe in the product or solution so deeply that I want everyone who faces this problem to know that we exist?

Taken to the extreme: Like a mother hearing seeing and hearing her newborn cry, do I *feel* the pain that my customers feel when they don't have a solution to their problem?

The answer has to be yes. You have to care about your mission, business, and product for you to be a hall of fame caliber marketer. You can be an average or good marketer, but to be one of the best, you have to commit to excellence.

Always put the customer first. When you don't know what to do, talk to them. What problems do they face? What solutions have they tried? What worked and didn't work? Where do they go to look for solutions? 

Talking to a minimum of 5 customers will leave you a map with some rough coordinates to follow.

This is where you'll find my latest writings. I'm creating a playbook that I wish I had when I was early in my career.  These are notes from what I've learned from personal experience and what I am yet to learn but have absorbed from courses, podcasts, videos, books, and more. 

I have a lot more I want to write so I'll use this MOC also as my content roadmap.

I hope you find value.
