Let’s talk about aligning your channel with where you’re at in the startup journey. We want to pick the right gear for the decathalon we're competing in. 

### Align your channel with your startup stage

Broadly, there are four stages of a startup:
1. Ideation, Validation, Launch.
In the beginning stages, forget about scaling. Your job is to do the stuff that doesn't scale. We’re talking about hustling to get your first 10 customers. These folks might be your friends, family, or that buddy you used to work with who always believed you’d start something someday. This phase is all hands-on deck, personal touches, sending emails one by one, maybe even knocking on doors. Not glamorous, but absolutely essential.

2. Growth
You’ve done the manual, unglamorous groundwork. You've secured a handful of paying customers and are starting to acquire customers that came to you organically! It’s time to find that one or two acquisition channels. These are channels that can scale with you. The most important part of this is that you don’t spread yourself too thin. You don’t need or want a dozen channels; you need one or two that really work.

3. Scale
You’ve found your groove, your 1-2 channels are bringing in a majority of your users, and you’re starting to feel the wind in your hair. You’re scaling. This is the point where you feel like you're starting to max out those initial channels. This is when you start bringing in field experts who can fine-tuning your process and operations even more to get that extra 5% growth. This is when you start swinging big to land that major influencer or running a long-term campaign to get the number one result on a high volume keyword. You might even consider running more experiments to find a 3rd channel to diversify your sources.

4. Maturity
I don't have much to say here because I haven't worked at a Google or Apple. If you're lucky enough to lead your startup to this level, you'll probably be writing your own playbook.

### Framework for choosing the right channels to test

- Goal
Start with the goal. What's the game plan? Raising brand awareness and getting paying customers are two different beasts. Hint: Most of the time, you're likely wanting to acquire paying users especially in the early stages.

- TAM (Total Addressable Market)
Take a hard look at the channel and ask, “Are the people I want to serve here?” You need to know if your ICP hangs out there. If your TAM on that channel is like looking for a needle in a haystack, you might want to reconsider.

- Intent
Now think about what mindset people are in when they're on that channel. Are they here to scroll endlessly, ready to whip out their credit card, or just looking for a laugh? Align your channel with the intent that matches your goal.

-  Precision
Some channels let you zero in on your audience while others follow a more broad pattern.  The more precisely you can target, the better your chances of hitting bullseye.

- Ease
Is this channel easy to test out by clicking a few buttons or does it require you to jump through some loops, schedule calls with people, and go through an external approval process? You want a channel where you can run quick experiments without needing to burn through your own time.

- Cost
Cost can also mean time, but I'm primarily talking about money. Some channels, like cold outreach, are free to test. Others require some money and others require a lot of money.  Weigh the potential ROI against the cost. Remember, expensive doesn’t always mean better.

- Speed
How fast can you go from not being in front of your ICP to being in front of them? Channel speeds vary from you needing to create assets to going through an external process like partnerships. Remember that your goal is to learn, the faster you can learn, the better.
