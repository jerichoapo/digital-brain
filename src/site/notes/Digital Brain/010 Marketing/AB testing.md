Here's a framework for on how to think through A/B testing

1) Clarify
- What are we looking to solve?
- What's the current behavior?
- Current feedback/problem?
- All users?

2) Resurface company's mission, goals, north star metric

3) Hypothesis (brainstorm 3 ideas)
- I'm assuming that by doing X it will Y
- Choose 1, explain why not the other 2

4) Methodology
- 3 cohorts: control, A, B
- Define target users in cohort (segment)
- Define goal
- Define what each segment will experience

5) Metrics
- Define metric for each test
- What metrics will convey the data?
- AAARRR

6) Impact
- What metrics used to make a data-informed decision to launch or not?
- Relate to mission, goal, north star metric
- Hypothesis?

6) Tradeoffs
- Pitfalls of the hypothesis, testing
- Launching vs not launching
