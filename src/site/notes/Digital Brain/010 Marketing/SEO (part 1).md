SEO. I have a lot to say here. The magic sauce that turns your online ghost town into Times Square. But really, it's not magic; it's smart, strategic work. It's using the internet the way the Google overlords want us to. Content that is trustworthy, easy to organize and index, and well-written.

The game of SEO is about getting your website to show up higher on search engine results pages. Because being visible means more traffic, and more traffic means more potential customers discovering your thing that you built. For startups, this visibility is gold. It's not just about being seen, it's about being seen by the right people at the right time.

### How search engines work

Here's the deal: search engines are like the librarians of the internet. They index billions of pieces of content and evaluate them based on hundreds of factors to decide which piece answers your query best. They look at things like keywords, site usability, how many other sites link to a page, and a lot more that we can understand. Imagine it like Google's brain. I know other search engines exist, but let's be real, Google is still the search king. Getting to grips with SEO can help you tailor your website to play nice with these algorithms.

Google and others tweak their algorithms regularly, and sometimes these updates can shake up the rankings like a snow globe. Over the years, we've seen changes like Google's Panda and Penguin updates, which clamped down on low-quality content and sketchy link schemes. Understanding these milestones is key because it teaches us what search engines value and how we can align with that.

There's also a thing now called ChatGPT, and while people will still be searching on Google, we can't ignore the fact that generative AI is changing the landscape. I don't know how to be the result that ChatGPT spits out, but we do know that it searches the internet for results. So technically, it actually depends on SEO to get recent data.

### Keyword research

Keywords are the compass for your SEO strategy. They guide what content you should create and how you can connect with your target audience. It's all about getting into the heads of your potential customers and understanding what they're searching for.

There are tools and tricks of the trade for digging up the goldmine of keywords that can drive your strategy. I recommend choosing between Semrush or Ahrefs, either of these will work for 90% of your SEO needs.

Long-tail keywords are your secret weapon. So instead of "best website builder", it's "best no-code website builders for non-technical people", that might be a bit overkill but you get the idea.  They're more specific, less competitive, and they're a direct line to user intent. When you understand what your audience is really looking for, you can craft content that speaks directly to their needs.

### Content marketing + SEO

It's peanut butter and jelly. Jordan and Pippen. Some other thing that belong together, I can't think of one right now.

Anyways, a solid content strategy is the foundation of your SEO efforts. It's about creating content that's not just relevant and valuable but also optimized for the keywords you want to rank for.

The goal is to create content so good that people can't help but share it. This not only drives organic traffic but also builds backlinks (I'll talk about off-page SEO later), which are a major SEO ranking factor. Think about what makes content valuable to your audience and how you can stand out.

Understanding your user's journey is crucial. The ideal scenario is that you have content that caters to every stage â€“ from awareness to consideration to decision. But startups aren't always ideal, you don't have infinite budget, or people, or time. So I say start by SEO optimizing your main pages like your homepage. From there you can branch out and optimize pages that need to exist like maybe an about page, features page, etc.

After you've done the groundwork, it's time to add the sprinkles by conducting keyword research from your ICP interviews and mapping out the content that address your ICPs pains. What do they talk about frequently? What solutions have they tried? 

Ask good questions, shut up, and listen. Your ICP will literally guide you on what kind of content you should be making, sometimes granular to the point where they'll tell you the exact keywords you should be targeting. Sometimes as specific as what the title of your content should be.

Remember, SEO isn't just a tactic. It's a fundamental part of building a brand that lasts. It's about being where your customers are, answering their questions, and solving their problems. Get this right, and you're not just optimizing for a bot crawler. You're optimizing for the success of your startup.
