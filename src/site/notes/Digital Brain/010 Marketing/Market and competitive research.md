I have mixed feelings about market and competitive research. Don't get me wrong, it's absolutely important. But my take is that if you're truly obsessed with solving a specific problem, you might not care about the market size. But investors care about growth potential and you likely care about getting funding, so here we are.
### Understanding Total Addressable Market (TAM)

The core idea here is getting a grip on "How many people can I actually serve?"

This is your potential growth playground. It’s the total market demand for the product or service you offer. This matters because it sets the boundaries of your ambition. It helps you answer the big question: How big could this thing get? 

### Here's a framework to calculate TAM
1. **Define Your Target Customer.** We talked about this in the last section. Pinpoint the demographics, geographics, and psychographics of your ideal customer. Who are they? Where do they live? What are their interests, needs, and behaviors? 
2. **Analyze Market Segmentation.** Break down the larger market into segments that represent your target customer groups. This could be based on industry, location, product type, customer size, etc.
3. **Research Market Size.** Use industry reports, market research studies, and government databases to find the total number of potential customers in each segment. Look for the most recent and relevant data. The numbers won't be perfect, but you're trying to get some rough estimates to have a sense of the size.
4. **Determine Penetration Rate.** Assess your product’s or service's potential penetration rate in each segment. Consider factors like competition, market trends, and your product’s unique value proposition.
5. **Calculate Revenue Potential.**
	1. Average Revenue Per User (ARPU): Estimate the average revenue you expect to generate per customer annually. This will vary based on your pricing model, product type, and customer segment.
	1. Multiply for TAM: For each segment, multiply the total number of potential customers by the estimated ARPU to get the revenue potential. Sum these figures across all segments to get your TAM.

### How to run competitive research

Here's how you play it smart without getting lost in the weeds. First, identify who's in your sandbox. Use Google, sift through industry insights, and lurk around social media to figure out your main competitors. Think of this as drawing your own map of the "who's who" in your space.

Deep dive into their offerings. Subscribe, try things out, and comb through their websites. Pay close attention to their features, pricing, and how they handle customers. Understand what they bring to the table and identify any gaps you could fill.

Scout their social media, blog, and SEO tactics. Tools like SEMrush or Ahrefs are great for spying on their online performance. You’re looking for their strengths and maybe where they're not quite hitting the mark.

Customer feedback can be a goldmine. Reviews on platforms like Google, G2, Yelp, etc. can reveal a lot. You’re after patterns in praises or gripes that could spotlight opportunities for you.

If it's out there, peek at their financials. Public companies make it easy, but for the private ones, you might have to do a bit of detective work. Understanding their financial standing can give you a clue about their market power.

Check out how they're selling. Are they online all the way, using partners, or a blend? Seeing how they reach their customers could open up new channels for you or highlight areas they're overlooking.

Branding and messaging are also key. How do they position themselves, and what's their story? This is your chance to differentiate your brand and find your unique space in the market.

Compile all this into a competitive analysis that's more than just a document—it's a playbook for your strategy. It should inform your decisions, from product tweaks to marketing campaigns.

Your competition aren't those who offer a similar technology. It's those who are targeting the same customers with a similar problem. Those who solve the same problem for the same target customers.
### The research trap. Customers > Competition/Market

Obsessing over the competition can lead you down a path of reactive strategies, where you’re always one step behind, mimicking rather than innovating. It feels productive to lurk.

Market and competitive research are about painting a comprehensive picture of where you stand today and where you could go tomorrow. But remember that it's not the "market" or your competitors that you serve, it's your customers. 

Successful startups know that the customer comes first, always. While competitive research is vital, it should never overshadow the importance of deeply understanding and prioritizing your customers' needs.
