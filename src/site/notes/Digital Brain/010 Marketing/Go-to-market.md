There's a lot here and it's still not enough. Going to market is an exciting endeavor. I see it like a space shuttle launch but people won't die if you do it wrong (and if it is, I'd like to know what kind of marketing you do so I can avoid that industry because I still get things wrong).

I myth I want to dispel is that GTM isn't just the actual launch itself, it begins *before* the product is completed. You should have some influence on how to finetune the product based on your market, competitive, and user research. 

1) Research

Market research
- What's the market landscape like?
- What is your total addressable market?
- What are the key trends in the market?
- Why is now the right time to launch?
- What are analysts/experts/thought leaders saying about the market gaps and opportunities?

Competitive research
- Who are our competitors?
- How does our product compare?
- What makes our product/approach unique?
- What do we believe is our unique value proposition?

User research
- Who are our target personas?
- What are their needs and challenges?
- How does our product meet their needs?

2) Planning

Once we have key insights, we can put them to use
- Objectives and goals
- AAARRR
- KPIs and metrics that align to the goal (mission and north star)
- Crafting messaging and positioning framework
	- User personas
	- Messaging pillars
	- Value propositions
- Goal: Reach the right audience at the right place, at the right time, with the right message
- Omnichannel and integrated approach to ensure it reaches a broad but relevant audience
	- PR
	- Demand gen (webinars, landing pages)
	- Field marketing (events, tradeshows, conferences, etc)
	- Content marketing (blog posts, white papers, datasheets, etc)
	- Social media marketing
	- Paid advertising
- Understand the budget and team capacity and build a hypothesis on the ROI of the marketing spend with respect to resources

 3) Execution
- Creating a detailed project plan with tasks broken down
- Assigning roles and responsibilities
- Timeline, due dates
- Check-ins and retros
- Continuously gather customer feedback to improve GTM strategy
	- Track usage, adoption, revenue metrics
	- Improve onboarding
	- AAARRR
		- How are the KPIs and metrics performing?
		- Are we getting closer to our goals and objectives or farther away?
- Execution is the work. it must be cross-collaborative, agile, and treated like a dance
