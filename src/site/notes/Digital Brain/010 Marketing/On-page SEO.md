SEO is broken down into 3 main categories. On-page, off-page, and technical

On-page SEO is quite literally what's on the page. Everything you need to know about on-page SEO can be summed up in once sentence: "Answer the question that the person online is searching for."

Easier said than done. Let's get into the specifics.
### Content quality and relevance
First up, content quality and relevance. Google's not just looking for content, it's looking for content that answers the searcher's query *better* than anyone else's. That means your content needs to be top-notchâ€”well-researched, well-written, and packed with value. It's like when you're at a party, you don't just want to be there, you want to be the one everyone's talking about. Or if you're an introvert, you're not just trying to meet everyone. You're looking to connect with that one really cool person who is knowledgeable, relatable, but also just seems like a genuinely awesome person. That's what you want your content to be.

Now, onto the nitty-gritty: optimizing your title tags, images, meta descriptions, structure, and internal linking.
### Title
Think of your title as the headline of your content in the Google search results, make it pop.

Good example: "10 time management strategies for busy students (with infographics)"
Bad example: "Time management tips"

You want to be specific, actionable, and unique. 
### Graphics
Images help. But not just the random stock footage from Unsplash. No, this isn't 2010. It's easy enough to use Canva to create an infographic. Make sure the images actually add value and can stand alone by themselves because then you can pop up on image search too.

Good example: A custom infographic you made that repurposes your content on the graphic
Bad example: Stock images
### Meta description
Meta descriptions are like the teaser to a movie. Titles matter more, but meta descriptions help add that extra flavor.

Good example: "Discover 10 powerful time management strategies designed specifically for busy students who want to boost productivity and get great grades."
Bad example: "This article has tips on managing your time better."
### Structure
Headers break up your content and make it easy to digest (plus, Google loves a well-structured article).  URL structure matters more than you think. A clean, descriptive URL not only tells your visitor what to expect on the page but also gives Google clues about the content's topic. It's like making sure your address is clear so your party guests can find you without ending up at the wrong house.

Good URL: yourwebsite[dot]com/blog/10-time-management-strategies-for-students-with-infographic
Bad URL: yourwebsite[dot]com/12-19-2023-blog-postpost-12-time-management-tips
### Internal linking
Internal linking is where you get to flex your site structure muscles. By linking to other content on your site, you're not just helping your visitors find more of your amazing content, you're also helping Google understand which pages are important and how they're related. Think of it as introducing your new friends to your old friends at a party, you're helping everyone get connected and have a good time. The best part is when bigger websites link to you, I'll talk about off-page SEO next.

In essence, mastering these on-page SEO essentials is about making your site irresistible to both search engines and humans. It's not rocket science, but it does take a bit of know-how and a lot of attention to detail. So, roll up your sleeves, dive in, and start optimizing. The top of the search results page is waiting for you.
