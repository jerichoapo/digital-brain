A little hard to write about this because I'm opting to not have visuals on this website and not bee jargony but let's try it. Technical SEO is the process of optimizing the infrastructure of a website so search engines like Google it can easily crawl and index it. Okay that was a lot of jargon. 

Think of it as the behind-the-scenes crew at a rock concert. Sure, the band (your content) is the star, but without the crew getting the stage, lights, and sound right, the show doesn't go on. Technical SEO is making sure your website's infrastructure is set up so search engines can find you, understand what you're all about, and put you in the spotlight.

Note: I won't go into the detailed *how* but I'll cover the high level stuff. Googling how exactly to do it will be your best bet.

1. Website speed and mobile friendliness
Speeding up your website starts with understanding where the slowdowns are happening. Tools like Google's PageSpeed Insights are your best friends here, offering a clear breakdown of what's up and how to fix it. Common culprits? Large images that need compressing (you don't need a 20mb ultra high-res image on your post) or too many redirects. As for making your site mobile-friendly, responsive design is your golden ticket. I'm no design expert but this means your site adjusts seamlessly to any screen size, making it a dream to navigate on any device. Open up your website on your phone and swipe and tap around. It should be a great experience. 

2. HTTPS for security
Moving to HTTPS is like upgrading from a deadbolt to a full security system on your website. First step? Check if your site’s already using HTTPS. A quick glance at your URL in the browser will tell you—look for "https://" at the start and a padlock icon. Not there? You’ll need to purchase an SSL certificate from your hosting provider. Once you’ve got that, it’s usually a matter of following the provider's process to implement it. This might involve some technical steps, but most hosting services offer guidance or support to make the switch as painless as possible.

3. Creating and optimizing an XML sitemap
Creating an XML sitemap is like drawing a map for Google, showing all the important pages on your site. You can use a variety of tools or plugins (like Yoast SEO for WordPress sites) to generate one automatically. Once you have your sitemap, it’s about keeping it clean. Only include URLs you want indexed, keep it updated as you add or remove pages, and use it to highlight the most critical parts of your site. Then, submit your sitemap to Google Search Console to make sure Google has the latest version.

4. Schema markup for search visibility
Schema markup might sound like something out of The Matrix, but it’s basically just a code (or semantic vocab) that you put on your website to help search engines return more informative results for users. Think of it as a way to label your content so search engines can understand it—and present it—better. You can use Google’s Structured Data Markup Helper to start adding schema markup to your HTML. Choose the type of data (like articles, events, products), paste in the URL of the page or article, and start tagging your content with the appropriate properties. It’s a bit of manual work, but the payoff in search visibility can be huge.

Tackling these tasks is about more than just boosting your SEO; it’s about improving the overall experience for your users and making sure your site stands out in the crowded digital landscape. With the right tools and a bit of patience, you can take your site from good to great and see real results later down the line for your organic traffic and engagement.
