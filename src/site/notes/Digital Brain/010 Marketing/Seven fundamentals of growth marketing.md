Hopefully you're drinking the kool aid and it tastes good. Don't worry there's nothing in it other than pure goodness and realization that growth marketing is the secret sauce of startup success. 

This next part is what I've learned from my own experience and witnessing how the best leaders instill a culture of growth and learning. 

1. Curiosity over comfort
Above all else, your team and especially you, need to have an insatiable curiosity. It's not about sticking to what you know but constantly asking "What if?" and "Why not?". One of my favorite prompts is "What would happen if we..." Comfort zones are where growth goes to die. So encourage your team to question everything and to see problems not as a bad thing but as puzzles waiting to be solved.

2. Data-informed decisions
Your growth engine runs on data, not guesses. But here's the kicker: data is only as good as the decisions it drives. Oh and here's a curveball sometimes your data is missing, incomplete, or flat out wrong. Go figure. But operating *with* data is better than *without*. Equip your team with the tools and skills they need to collect, analyze, and act on data effectively.

3. Speed, agility, and more speed
Speed is your superpower. Foster an environment where moving fast and breaking things isn't just accepted, it's celebrated. Celebrate your failures just as much as you celebrate wins. Failures = lessons on how to be better. 

4. Prioritize with your North Star
Here's the catch though, speed without direction is pure chaos. Ensure your speed is aligned with strategic objectives—your company's guiding North Star. If you're surrounded by smart people, they'll have more ideas than you can ever execute and if you try to do them all really really fast, you're going to have a bad time. Prioritizing your actions based on your startup's core mission means that your actions lead to meaningful progress, not just activity and output for the sake of it.

5. Experimentation as a habit
The path to growth is paved with experiments—lots of them. Some will succeed, many will fail, but all will teach you something. Create a culture where experimentation is the norm, where every failure is a step closer to success, and where every team member feels empowered to test their hypotheses.

6. Keep things simple
Complexity is the enemy of execution. The best growth strategies are often the simplest ones. Strip ideas down to their essence and to focus on execution. It's about doing a few things exceptionally well, not everything just okay.

7. Be customer-obsessed
Saved the best for last. Not to be creepy or anything but it’s not enough to just ‘understand’ your customers, you’ve really gotta live and breathe their world. When a customer sees your landing page or opens your email or reads your social caption, they should say "Wow. They get me."
