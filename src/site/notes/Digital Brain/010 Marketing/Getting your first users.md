The early days are tough but this is when you want to be as close as possible to your first users to see how they interact with your product. This is you putting a little bit of fuel in your engine and seeing if it starts. It probably won't. It's very likely that you find something broken. But you'll be surprised to find that maybe one or two things are actually giving your early users a good experience.
### Finding early adopters in your network

Tap into your personal and professional network. This is your low-hanging fruit. But don't just blast a generic "check out my new thing" message. Personalize it. Make each person feel like they're being invited to an exclusive club. Why? Because people love feeling special. 

Don't waste your time inviting everyone and anyone, they have to fit your early vision of an ICP. Start with a list and think about your college buddy, former coworkers, your LinkedIn connections, even family member. Tell them why you think they'll specifically benefit from your product. 

### The golden elif statement

When you reach out, whether they say yes or no, follow the golden elif statement: ask them if they know someone who might be interested. This is your first taste of a referral program, we'll talk more about that later. This isn’t just about getting users; it’s about building your first community of believers. You don't need 100 users this early in the game, you just need 10 to be your alpha testers. 

### Get creative beyond your circle

Once you've gone through your contacts, it's time to get creative. Here are a few strategies:

- **Startup communities.** This is where I'd start. Dive into local meetups, hackathons, or online platforms like Startup Grind, Product Hunt, or AngelList. Share your journey, seek advice, and genuinely engage. It's a give-and-take environment; be ready to offer your own insights and support to others as well.
- **Online communities.** Facebook groups, Slack communities, Reddit, forums related to your product. Don't go in guns blazing with a sales pitch. Contribute, add value, and then softly introduce what you're working on.
- **Partnership and Collaboration.** This is harder and more complicated. I wouldn't prioritize this but it could be big. The idea is to team up with other startups or businesses that complement your product. Companies that share your target audience but aren’t direct competitors. Collab on webinars, co-authoring blog posts, or cross-promoting each other’s services can open your startup to a whole new audience.

### Authentic cold outreach

The key here is to be authentic. Don't use "we" like you're a huge corporation. Use "I" because that's the reality, *you* are looking for users for your product. Write like how you talk, people buy from people so talk like a person. Talk about your journey, the problem you're passionate about solving, and why you think the person on the other end of the message could really benefit from what you have to offer. Don't write a novel, keep it concise yet compelling.

Subject: Can I get your thoughts on something I've built?

Hi [name],

P.S. If you don't think this is the right fit for you, I'd still love to know why! No hurt feelings here.

Regardless if they say yes or no, remember the golden elif statement: ask if they know anyone else that might be interested in your product.

And that's it. You're not pretending to be a faceless brand, you're a person reaching out to another person for a bit of help and insight. That's the kind of authenticity that can turn a cold email into a warm connection.
