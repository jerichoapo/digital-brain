If on-page SEO is like making sure your house is clean and welcoming for guests, off-page SEO is your reputation around the neighborhood. It’s the stuff that’s happening away from your site but has everything to do with how other other reputable websites link and refer to your content. 

Off-page SEO is all the actions you take outside of your own website to impact your rankings within search engine results pages (SERPs). Think of it as the buzz around your startup at other parties, not just your own; and guess what? Some of that off-page juice are things you control like outreach (I'll talk more about that later) and some aren't things you control like organic off-page from other websites linking to your content because it's so helpful and unique.

### Importance of backlinks

The crown jewel of off-page SEO: backlinks. These are links from other sites back to yours. Why are they important? Because every backlink is like a vote of confidence in the eyes of search engines. It’s as if someone’s saying, “Hey, check this out, these folks know what they’re talking about.” The more high-quality backlinks you have, the more search engines believe your site is a credible source, which can seriously bump up your rankings.

### Six ways to build SEO backlinks

So, how do you get these golden tickets? It’s not spamming forums or buying links. Building high-quality backlinks it's creating killer content that people want to share, leveraging relationships with influencers or industry leaders, and guest blogging on reputable sites in your niche. It’s about providing value so irresistible that others can’t help but link to it.

1) Design content for humans first, then backlinks next
First and foremost, your creating content for humans to read so always put them first. Then to increase your chances of getting backlinks, create content that is worthy of linking. Content that answers questions, solves problems, or just blows people's minds. We're talking ultimate guides, in-depth research, insightful case studies, or even controversial takes that get people talking. Make it so good that other sites can’t help but reference it.

2) Guest blogging
Guest blogging isn't dead; it's just evolved. The key is to contribute to reputable sites where your target audience hangs out. Don't just pitch a thinly-veiled ad for your startup. Offer genuine value. Share your unique insights, experiences, or data. It’s a win for both sides. You get exposure and a backlink, they get great content.

3) Relationships: the long game
Networking isn't a dirty word. Build relationships with influencers, bloggers, and other startups in your space. Engage with their content, offer genuine feedback, and when the time is right, introduce them to your content that genuinely adds value to their audience. It’s not about what you can get, it’s about what you can give.

4) Be a source for reporters and writers
Tools like HARO (Help a Reporter Out) are goldmines for scoring backlinks. Reporters are always looking for experts to quote in their articles. Offer your insights, and you might just land a backlink from a major publication. Remember, be quick, be helpful, and be specific in your responses.

5) Social media... responsibly.
No, simply posting your links on social media isn’t going to directly boost your SEO. Yes, posting your links to Reddit or Quora raises eyebrows in a bad way. But, engaging in conversations, provide value, and subtly introduce content that enhances the discussion. That's the stuff that'll help you build a good reputation. Give away your writing for free, literally copy/paste it on the platform and then you can do a subtle promo like "Hey I wrote about this here if you want to read more" or "I'm writing more stuff like this, DM me if you want to see more. Would love to get your feedback".

6) Fix broken backlinks
This one’s a bit more tactical. Look for reputable sites in your niche with broken links (there are tools for this like Ahrefs or Semrush). Then reach out and suggest your content as a replacement. It's helpful, non-intrusive, and can earn you a solid backlink.

Building backlinks is about playing the long game with integrity. It’s about creating so much value that others can’t help but share your content. Remember, every backlink is a testament to the quality of your content and the strength of your brand. So, get out there and start building—not just links, but relationships and a reputation that will solidify your startup's place in the digital landscape.

### Dos and don'ts of off-page SEO

- **Do:** Focus on creating valuable, shareable content.
- **Don't:** Buy backlinks. Just don’t. It’s not worth the risk.
- **Do:** Build relationships with other bloggers, influencers, and sites in your industry.
- **Don't:** Spam forums or comment sections with your links.
- **Do:** Guest post on reputable sites.
- **Don't:** Sacrifice quality for quantity. One high-quality backlink is worth more than a dozen low-quality ones.

Remember, off-page SEO isn’t about gaming the system. It’s about extending the reach and reputation of your brand in the vast digital landscape. It's the long game, but when done right, it can significantly amplify your online presence and drive organic growth like nothing else.
