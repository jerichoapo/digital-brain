I'll talk about two major and simple concepts that I use when it comes to metrics the North Star and Pirate Metrics.
### The North Star

The North Star Metric is like finding the guiding light for your entire team. It’s that one metric that truly captures the core value your product delivers to customers. Think of it as the heartbeat of your startup. Whether it’s daily active users, monthly recurring revenue, or something else, your North Star keeps everyone aligned and focused on what matters most. It’s not just a number; it’s the soul of your growth strategy.

When you have an idea or you're lost in the sauce of a campaign, ask yourself Why five times. If it leads to your North Star metric, cool. If it doesn't, reconsider if what you're doing makes sense.

### Pirate metrics

Let's get tangible. This focuses on the customer journey from start to finish: Awareness, Acquisition, Activation, Revenue, Retention, and Referral. It’s about understanding each stage of your customer's experience and optimizing it. 

From catching their eye (Awareness), getting them on board (Acquisition), lighting up their first “wow” moment (Activation), all the way to turning them into loyal fans who’ll sing your praises to others (Referral). 

Some examples:
- Awareness: web traffic, social impressions
- Acquisition: sign-ups, downloads
- Activation: log-ins, watching a video, posting
- Retention: DAU, WAU, MAU
- Revenue: MRR, ARR, CLV
- Referral: NPS, referring users
