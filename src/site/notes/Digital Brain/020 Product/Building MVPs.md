So let's say you have an idea.

Maybe it's an idea that can change the world. Maybe it's something that can grow to be your main source of income. Or maybe, it's just a little project. Something that'll be fun to do on the side.

Whatever that idea is. Before you sink money and a bunch of time into it, you want to validate if the idea is worth pursuing.

The traditional way of starting a business goes like this: you have an idea, you build the best possible product you can, sometimes this takes months or even years, and when you're ready... you launch to the world

The ideal situation is that people love what you built and it's a huge success

The worst case scenario is that you spent all this time and money into building the thing, that you didn't stop to think if you should test whether idea was going to work in the first place.

This is where the MVP comes in.

What's an MVP?

MVP stands for minimum viable product.

The concept is to test whether an idea is going to work in the least amount of initial investment possible in terms of time, money, and people.

It originates from the startup world and an example of this is when Zappos, the online shoe retailer, first started out.

How Zappos did it

Back in 1999, Nick Swinmurn assumed that there was a demand for people who wanted a more convenient way to buy shoes.

He believed that the solution was the first store where people can buy shoes without leaving the comfort of their home.

The first online shoe store.

Remember that this was 1999. One year before the world was supposed to end.

There were many risks in this business idea.

Do people trust a new website on the internet enough to enter their credit card, name, and address? Will people want to buy shoes without trying them on first? How do we know that this is actually going to work?

This is where the MVP comes into play.

To test the idea, Nick created a simple website and went to a shoe store to take pictures of the shoes he wanted to sell. When a customer placed an order, he would go back to the store, buy the shoe and then ship it to the customer.

This way, he didn't need to buy a bunch of different shoes in all kinds of sizes, store the inventory, and hope that he sells the shoes he just bought to make a profit.

Zappos started as an MVP in 1999 and 10 years later sold to Amazon for a $1.2 billion valuation. It's nuts.

Start thinking in MVPs

MVP thinking is powerful.

The main goal is to learn in the least amount of time, money, and people involved.

That means that you need to build the minimum version of your idea and get it in front of your ideal customers as fast as possible.

And that's just the beginning because the best part of this entire process is after the product is launched. You get to listen to peopleâ€™s feedback and learn how to build an even better product.

But that's a topic that I'll write about at another time. It's time for dinner.
