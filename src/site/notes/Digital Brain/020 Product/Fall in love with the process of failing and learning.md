If the world of marketing was in a fantasy setting, growth marketers are the crazy and eclectic scientists with wild hair mixing things together to produce explosive results — good or bad.

Growth marketers experiment rapidly and repeatedly. But there’s a method to the madness because, at the core, they are obsessed with the metrics that matter the most to the business.

They work across the entire organization and look at the full picture as opposed to traditional marketers who focus on the initial stages of the customer’s journey.

Growth marketing is an evolution of traditional marketing and started in the startup world.

As startup founders learned the build-measure-learn and agile philosophies, marketing leaders needed a way to speed up their own learning cycle.

Investors care about traction. They want to see that a product is desired by the market, that more people use the thing you built… and all this should happen in the shortest amount of time possible.

This is why growth marketers experiment. The goal is to find at least one channel with promising signs of traction.

There are a lot of failures involved in growth marketing and that’s one reason why having an objective mindset is a key trait.

Fall in love with the process of failing and learning. Celebrate your losses the same way you celebrate your wins.
