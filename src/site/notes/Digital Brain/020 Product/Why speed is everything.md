Speed is everything in business and in life.

The faster you get your work out to the market, the faster you can measure results and iterate. The faster you get better.

Perfectionism is a close relative to procrastination. Being perfect is subjective because 1) there’s no such thing as perfect and 2) a great product for you might be terrible for someone else.

But you won’t know the results until you ship the thing you created so you can get feedback. Speed is deadly because the more you ship product, the more you learn.

I don't remember where I read this quote, but it went something like:

> “Direction is more important than speed. Many are going nowhere fast.”

I disagree. 

I’d rather move fast in the wrong direction, realize I’m going the wrong way, and adjust.

Because the option to go slow and obsess and overanalyze and strategize on which direction is the right way.

Direction in the real world isn’t binary. It’s not a clear right or wrong. Direction in business is making educated guesses with the information you do have and adjusting as you go.

So that slow and careful decision could be wrong too, but you won’t know until you take action. Speed almost always win.
