Startups. I see startups similar to being a small business owner. It's the pursuit of building something that will help people, except you 100x the potential impact and scale and you try to do it as fast as possible. I've always wanted to build my own startup/product, but I'm still in search of a problem that no one has built a solution yet on how exactly I would solve it. I find that my time-to-impact is faster if I join a a solution that's already solving for that problem. So far that's what I've done and I've been lucky to join impactful startups UPchieve and DeepLearning.AI.
