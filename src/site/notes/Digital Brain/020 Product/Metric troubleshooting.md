"A metric is significantly up or down, what's going on?"

1) Clarify
- Timeline: when did this start?
	- Progressive or sudden?
- Technical: all platforms? mobile (os), desktop?
- Geography: specific location or all across?
- Users: specific users? beta? specific patch or feature opt-in? age-group, tech savvy?

2) 3 buckets

a) External
- Competitors launch?
- Bad or good press?
- OS update the caused break?
- New startup or competition?

b) Internal company
- Cannibalization
- Launched something that attracted or repelled users?
- Lose key engineer that affect quality of code?
- Sunset a feature that is connected or isolated but people who dropped out were using?
- Another team launch an experiment or in one?

c) Internal team
- Did we launch an experiment?
- Did we deprioritize a feature or ticket that was critical or urgent?
- Did we deprioritize a produce in favor of another?

3) Pick a variable/reason and decide on it
- "From the data/what I know, this could be X"

4) How to validate and metrics to track

5) Counterpoint other possibilities
