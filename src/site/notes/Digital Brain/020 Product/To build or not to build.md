A framework I stole from product managers. This still translates well to marketers and the countless tactics and channels we can be on. Just because we *can* doesn't always mean we *should*

1) Clarify: hardware or software? stand-alone? pre-launch or launch?
- What problem is this solving?

2) Define mission, goal, and north star metric
- Define product and goal of product

3) Market analysis
- Current company value proposition (3)
- Problems w/ value prop and why new product could make sense
- [[Digital Brain/010 Marketing/Market and competitive research\|Market and competitive research]]
	- What are competitors doing?
	- What are they not doing?
- Market/industry landscape

4) Discuss specific user segments
- Do we launch to a segment or launch to all?

5) User pain point: "As a user, I want to X, but I Y"

6) 3 benefits of improvement
- How does it address need?
- How does it relate to mission and north star?

7) Tradeoffs

8) Is it worth building?
- Why? why not? -- be confident
- Timing?
- How does product/feature fit w/ existing product line?

9) Alternative to reach goal
- Brainstorm solutions
	- Acquire
	- Partner
	- Social communities
	- Build as a beta feature first

10) Pick one and why
- Short term
- What it could turn into (vision)

11) Metrics to track
- AAARRR
- Pick 1 and why

12) Tradeoffs/counterpoints
- Competitors already doing, beta, or have done it and failed
- Something we can integrate first as a feature to an existing product?
- Burning question (time, money, people); if we say yes to this, what are we saying no to?
