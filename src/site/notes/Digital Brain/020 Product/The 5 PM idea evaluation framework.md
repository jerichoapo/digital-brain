From This Week In Startups. I way to validate startup ideas

### Problem
- Is this an important problem?
- Is this an urgent problem? Urgency = vitamin vs aspirin 
- Important and urgent make up a 2x2 matrix

### Purchaser
- Does this market adopt new tech?
- Do they have the willingness or ability to pay?
- Sophistication
	- B2C - consumer
	- B2A - aspirational; photographers, bloggers
	- B2B - business
	- B2E - enterprise (long sales cycles, fewer deals, larger deals)

### Pricing model
- Subscription or not?
- ARPA estimate
- Monthly, annual, share of revenue, etc.

### Market
- Size - TAM
- Ease of reach of customers (Are they online?)
- Is the market early or mature? Growing, declining, flat?
- Competition (How much? Big companies or other startups?)

### Product Founder fit
- What about your background and access to this market makes you the right person to build this?
- If this idea is highly technical, do you have the tech chops?
- If this idea is a crowded space, do you have marketing chops?
- Founder's unique advantage
	- Audience
	- Network
- Do you love this problem?

### Pain to validate
- Time to market/MVP
- Pain of building
