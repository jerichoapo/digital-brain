You'll get broad questions that require a somewhat specific answer. How many customers do you think X will produce? What's the expected ROI of Y if we do it for an entire quarter? How much would it cost us to commit to Z1 and stop doing Z2?

It's hard especially when X, Y, and Z are things that haven't been done before or the data is limited. There is no easy answer, but know that you just need to give a rough estimation so that the CEO or CFO has something to work with. This isn't exactly accounting, you just need to hit somewhere in the ballpark. 

1) Clarify the problem
- ex. State the weight of a school bus
	- Full tank of gas?
	- How many people?

2) Break down the problem
- Engine, interior, exterior, tires

3) Estimate each segment
- Estimate by proxy
	- 300k households x2 cars = 600k cars
- Personal references
	- 50% of my friends have cars = half of my age group
- Upper and lower bounds
	- 0 cars or 500,000 cars

4) Final answer

5) Gut check / sanity check

6) Why you're wrong
