This framework is more product management than marketing. Regardless, it's a brain exercise for thinking about designing a strategy behind a product

1) Clarify: hardware or software? stand-alone? pre-launch or launch?

2) Define mission, goal, and north star metric
- Define product and goal of product

3) Market analysis
- Current company value proposition (3)
- Problems w/ value prop and why new product could make sense
- [[Digital Brain/010 Marketing/Market and competitive research\|Market and competitive research]]
	- What are competitors doing?
	- What are they not doing?
- Market/industry landscape

4) List user segments and pain points
- Age, tech-savvy, earnings, needs
- How do they interact with the product?

5) Pick 1 to focus on and why not the other 2

6) Dive deep into the problems of 1 user segment
- 3 pain points
- "As a user, I want to X, but I Y"
- Reflect it back to the north star, mission, and prioritize most relevant/biggest need

7) Brainstorm 3-5 solutions
- "What if..."
- "Imagine if..."

8) Pick one and explain why not other (north star/mission)
- How to validate: focus group, poll, interview, survey
- MVP: user journey

9) Metrics to track
- AAARRR
- Pick 1 and why

8) Tradeoffs/counterpoints
- Competitors already doing, beta, or have done it and failed
- Something we can integrate first as a feature to an existing product?
- Burning question (time, money, people); if we say yes to this, what are we saying no to?
