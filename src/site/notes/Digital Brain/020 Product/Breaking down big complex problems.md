The bigger your role, the more you'll get exposed to complex puzzles to solve. Here are a few concepts on how to break down big problems into smaller and solvable pieces

1. **Decomposition.** The process of breaking down a complex problem into smaller and more manageable parts. It involves dividing the problem into smaller sub-problems or sub-tasks that can be tackled independently. For example, if a programmer is working on a software project, they may decompose the project into different modules or functions that can be developed separately.

2. **Abstraction.** The process of simplifying complex problems by hiding unnecessary details and focusing on the essential components. It involves identifying the critical features of a problem and ignoring the irrelevant details. For example, in programming, abstraction can be achieved by using functions or classes to encapsulate complex operations, so they can be called as a single unit without worrying about the underlying implementation.

3. **Modularity.** The practice of breaking down a system into smaller, independent components or modules that can be developed and tested separately. Each module is designed to perform a specific task or set of tasks, and the modules can be combined to create a larger system. For example, in software engineering, modularity can be achieved by creating separate modules for input/output, data storage, and user interface, which can be developed and tested independently.

4. **Top-down design.** A design approach where a problem is initially viewed as a whole, and then broken down into smaller components or sub-tasks. The process involves starting with a high-level overview of the problem and gradually breaking it down into smaller and smaller components until the individual steps needed to solve the problem become clear. For example, a programmer can use top-down design to break down the development of a large software system into smaller modules that can be developed independently.

5. **Divide and conquer.** Divide and conquer is a problem-solving strategy that involves breaking down a problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems and solving them independently. The idea is to tackle a large problem by dividing it into smaller pieces, and then solving each piece separately. For example, in algorithm design, divide and conquer can be used to solve complex problems such as sorting a large list of numbers by breaking it into smaller lists and sorting each list independently.
