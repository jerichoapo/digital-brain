One of the earliest memories I have was selling Pokemon cards to my schoolmates in 3rd grade.

I think the year was 1999? Pokemon had become a hit in the Philippines and everyone watched the show and played the game on their Gameboys... or watched a classmate play it on their Gameboy. It was a real life version of Twitch.

I don't remember how exactly I got my first Pokemon cards. I remember the booster packs had either Venusaur, Blastoise, or Charizard on the front.

I saved up my allowance to buy these booster packs without knowing how to play the game. I knew other kids had them at school so I wanted some too. I didn't know what they were doing, I don't think any of us knew the rules.

But I remember one of the local toy stores would sell the cards individually. There were in binders and it hit me that I can do that too.

It was called a Trading Card Game, but I didn't want to trade a card for a card. I wanted to make money out of it so I can buy more cards to sell. So I bought a binder and meticulously organized my cards alphabetically at first, then by the number on the lower right. 

I stopped playing the game and was more interested in buying booster packs and selling the individual cards. The funny thing is, I don't actually know if I made a profit. I loved the act of buying a booster pack, seeing what cards I got, organizing them in my binder, and putting a price on it.

Sometimes I made up the price, but I knew which cards were worth money. The holographic ones and the rare ones. If I couldn't come up with the price, I'd go to a local shop and see how much they were selling them.

Soon I'd visit more often and I'd be known as the little kid looking through their inventory and writing the prices down with my index card and pencil. I don't think they had the slightest idea I was stealing their price.

My core memory is my mom reacting to me coming home with a wad of cash when the days were good. I remember that feeling of joy and being proud of myself. We were still broke at this time after all.

One thing I regret was not keeping my rare cards, I definitely had a few Charizards that I unpacked and sold. But I was just a 10 year old kid with a dream of making a quick buck. Good times.
