In sports, just like in business, the talent is broken down into different levels. 

You have people who never make it past the practice squad or leave the bench. Role players who contribute meaningfully when called upon. Starters who are consistent great performers. Superstars who carry the team. Hall of famers who change the entire game.

People can be naturally gifted as a superstar. Some are born to run incredibly fast or born 6'8 with amazing coordination. In business, some are amazing technical thinkers or charismatic communicators. You can get far relying on your natural talents and putting in a little bit of effort.

But the hall of famers are the ones who understand that their talent alone isn't enough. They want more.

They're the first at gym and the last one out. They watch film and obsess over every detail. They practice a handful of moves, hundreds to thousands of times for days, weeks, months, years to master a few moves and countermoves to rely on.

What separates the great and the best is a mindset.

It's an insatiable hunger that can't be satisfied. Even when they've won the season, they're already thinking about how they can do better next year. It's a continuous grind of constant improvement.

In business, it's an obsession to hone your craft. As a marketer, you'll have the option and freedom to master many aspects of marketing. Don't.

Be great at a handful and dig even deeper. Develop [[Digital Brain/070 Career/The craftman's mindset\|The craftman's mindset]] where your value comes from being an with deep expertise. That can be a soft skill or a hard skill, whatever it is, commit to being the best you can be.

It's the moments when no one is watching that dictate whether you are a hall of famer, superstar, role player, or a scrub. You hold your destiny. Put in the work.
