For my own sake, I should start with why this website exists in the first place. It's a simple and shallow reason:

I love to write.

I've been journaling on and off since 2006 and I have more than a dozen of notebooks going back from my teenage years.

But as I get older, the shorter my journal entries get and the longer the gaps are in between each entry. So I want to keep writing and publicly document my thoughts.

There is a deeper reason of why this website exists.

I’ve been fortunate enough to fall into my career path. I’ve been given the opportunity either by luck, hard work, or both to end up where I am today.

The right people bet on me and I worked hard to make sure I delivered results. Now I’m here. I’ve learned a lot so far and am still learning.

My North Star is to to give back to the people who are walking a similar path that I was.

No one taught me how to build a brand. No one taught me to produce content. No one taught me how to grow a startup.

I learned by educating myself, doing it, making mistakes, and doing it all over and over and over again.

So whether you’re a day or a decade behind my foot steps, I’m hoping that what I write here teaches you a thing or two.

I don't have any ambitions to make money from this website or rank in search engines.

I’m simply here document my journey as a student. This is content I wish I had when I was figuring it all out.

So that's what this is. Welcome.
