I've been journaling since I took a creative writing class in 2007. It's part of my morning routine and I have a box of notebooks ranging from cheap composition notebooks that I could afford when I was in high school, to moleskins, and other random notebooks I thought were cool.

Journaling is one of the most important things anyone can do. It doesn't need to be in the morning, but a benefit of doing it before the day starts is you get to write out what you're thinking about whether that's excitement, anxiety, or anything in between. 

It's a way to reflect and reconnect with yourself. How are you feeling? How is life going? Are you happy? Why?

It's a way to set an intention; though this is something I haven't been great at doing. But I've replaced intention with gratitude and that's worked for me. Sometimes my gratitude is a small: I'm grateful for the the luxury to write. Sometimes it can be deeper: I'm grateful for how my life has played out and go into the details.

Reflections, intentions, gratitude. All these things don't need to wait until a milestone like a new year or a birthday. It can happen in the every day life. 

I'm not sure how I'll balance writing here vs. on my actual physical journals. I prefer writing things down, but I'll this is where I'll store notes that don't belong in the other categories.
