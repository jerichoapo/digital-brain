Create > consume
- Creating is an expression of your soul. It's leaving your legacy. Write, code, draw, record, whatever it is... **create**.

1 > 0
- 1% better every day adds up. A 10 minute walk is better than none. 10 minutes spent per day coding, reading, learning, etc. is 70 minutes of disciplined action per week. Put your head down, do the work, and trust the process.

Present > past + future
- Your past doesn't define you, your future doesn't confine you. Your past losses or wins belong in the past. How you see the future is a blind prediction of what you think could go wrong or right. None of these matter. What matters is what you do today, repeatedly over time.
