Ever since I was a kid, I've always loved to observe people.

One of my earliest memories was being at church with my mom. We'd sit somewhere in the middle and I remember I'd like to look behind us to see what people were doing.

My favorite was when we would be late to church (probably my fault) and we'd stand in the back. I loved it because being a kid, I could see almost everyone when they were sitting down. Were they listening to the priest? Were they dozing off? What were they wearing? How were they sitting? Who were they with?

I took the bus and train since we moved from the Philippines to the U.S. when I was 14. I always sat as far back as I could to do the same thing. I'm not watching people the entire time like a creep.  I'd listen to music and get lost in introspection too, but I always found it fascinating to see the people around me.

What I remember vividly was around 2017. This was when everyone had smart phones with large bright screens and everyone was looking down on their phones. Whether that's social media or texting or working during their commute.

I'd do the same thing, sit as close as possible to the back and I'd observe what people were doing except this time on their phones.

What were they looking at? What grabbed their attention? How were they navigating these apps? Are they having any moments of frustration using the app? What caused them to smile, or laugh, or look sad?

My morning and evening commutes turned into me studying random people and watching how they interact with technology.

I'm not sure *why* exactly I did and still do it. Perhaps it's me attempting to understand and connect with people better. To understand how 1s and 0s on a screen turn into human emotions. Or maybe it's just curiosity.
