Job titles don't mean too much to me. Coming from a place where I've worked in small organizations, everyone does a little bit of everything regardless of your job title.

A blessing and a curse for me was when my manager at The Story of Stuff Project left a couple of months after I started. This was my first full-time job after college and I found myself reporting to the Executive Director.

I would report to the Executive Director/CEO for the next 6 years of my career as I eventually got promoted to the Director of Marketing and started managing a team. I would take on the exciting work of hiring people and make difficult decisions to let people go.

What I wish someone told me before taking on a management or director role is that most of your time isn't going to be spend on your technical skill. You will get pulled away from the trenches to zoom out. 

You become responsible for much more than what's in front of you. You're responsible for setting goals, figuring out how to hit those goals, and owning the good and bad of hitting or missing those goals. You own an entire section of the ship and the captain trusts you to do right by them.

Your work becomes managing other people's work. Are their expectations clear? Are they hard enough where they feel challenged but on the brink of feasibility that it doesn't feel unreasonable? Are they showing up to work and putting in their best effort? Are they getting along with others?  Are they happy? How's life outside of work? Where do you think you'll be in the next 1-3 years? How can I be a better leader and manager?

It is both a rewarding and challenging aspect of knowledge work. Seeing someone evolve in their career from their first month to their first year, if done right, is a great feeling. You literally see their transformation of becoming a great employee.

You learn to delegate so you can focus on strategic planning and forward thinking. The risk to this is that you won't be in the weeds of the work itself and I must admit that sometimes doing the work and getting your hands dirty is deeply rewarding.

I don't have an answer for you if you should stay in an individual contributor role. What I can say is that if I was the CEO of a startup, I will favor the person who is 70% technical expertise/30% management skills, over someone who is 70% management/30% technical expertise.

Maybe I'll change my mind one day, but I respect those who can walk the talk. I think the build time for learning management skills is much shorter than the years it takes to build deep expertise in a technical skill.

For me, I'm choosing to take a step back from a "director" title. I choose to take the lieutenant hat off, unsheathe my katana, and get to work.
