I don't know if I've ever written about this publicly. I definitely have pages upon pages on my journal writing about it. Often with the ink smeared from the tears rolling down my face as I write. I mean shit, I'm tearing up right now.

It's hard to talk about but I think I need to do it. It's a deep pain that I don't think I'll fully heal from even as I write this now as a 32 year old with a wife, and a 2 month old son.

Growing up without a dad didn't really hit me until I was in my teenage years. I guess when my hormones kicked in.

I've always been a little lost in my teenage years to my early 20s. I spent a lot of time exploring my mind and trying to express it through writing. Journaling, poetry, rap.

High school in the U.S. was a blur to me. We moved when I was 14 years old and I was a sophomore in high school in the Philippines. I remember the school administrator recommended that I go back a year just so I have friends my age. I said no. So I became a junior at 15 and graduated high school at 16.

Everyone was older than me. Going to a suburban mostly-white mostly-affluent public high school, almost everyone had a full family. They had dads.

I hung out with the other asian, black, and hispanic kids. There were only a few of us but I felt like I belonged. There were some white kids that also had an incomplete family too. They were cool.

I don't remember much of high school really. I'd ride the bus to and from school. I played basketball at recess, lunch, and after school with my friends. Took the bus at sunset, sometime I'd walk.

I didn't really like being at home. It was me, my sister, and mom and we all lived in a small 1 bedroom apartment and shared the bedroom; probably 600 sq ft. I slept on a air mattress on the floor for a few years then eventually upgraded to a mattress on the floor.

We were broke. But I wasn't unhappy.

After high school, I worked at a frozen yogurt store near a Borders bookstore. That became my sanctuary. I'd get lost in the books and I spent a lot of time in the self-help, self-improvement, business/leadership sections.

I'd be there from the time I got off work at around 7 pm until the store closed at either 9 or 10, I don't exactly remember.

The books were my friends. The authors were my father figures. Their words resonated with me; advice that I wish I had gotten. Wisdom that I didn't know I yearned for.

Growing up without a father was tough. It was tough on me and my family. But it also made us tougher.

I'd be lying if I said "I wouldn't change a thing because it made me who I am today". That's bullshit. It would've been awesome to have someone to play catch with.
