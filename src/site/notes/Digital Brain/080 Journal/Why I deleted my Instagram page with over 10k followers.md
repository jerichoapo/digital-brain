Back in 2015, I started a brand called Hustle Grind Empire. It was basically a quotes page on Instagram that had a no B.S. approach. No private jets or lambos, just quotes for the working folks. 
## Why I built it

I built it for three reasons:

1) To build an audience of entrepreneurs who believe in what I believed in. That private jets and Rolexes didn't matter. What mattered was ambition and perseverance.

2) I was inspired by my friend and mentor Chris Reichert who was a serial entrepreneur and built businesses to support himself.

3) I had a lot of extra time in college and thought this would be something really cool to figure out and build. I had never done anything like it before.

## How I did it

Chris introduced me to Fiverr and Upwork where he finds affordable freelancers.

I was broke, so I budgeted $100 and bought an excel file of 30,000+ quotes on Fiverr, and hired a graphic designer to create quotes the quotes that I handpicked.

I scheduled content twice a day — one at 7 am and one at 7 pm.

I published consistently and slowly, people started finding my content and liking it enough to follow me. This was 2015 so organic Instagram was a lot easier back then.

I continued to publish and long story short, I hit over 10k followers in 2 months.

## Where it went wrong

So I hit the magic number I was chasing. It was a huge success… or so I thought.

My goal was to grow to 10k followers and the goal itself was the critical mistake.

I failed to think beyond hitting the vanity metric of 10k. I grew too quickly and I had no idea what to do with this audience.

I wrote a blog that I converted into an ebook and tried building an email list which was a fun experience. I reached my end goal so early that it felt like it was the end.

I still had about a year's worth of content so I put it all on autopilot and mindlessly published until I ran out of content.  I stopped engaging with my followers so my engagement and follower growth plateaued and eventually crashed.

People are smart. They'll figure out if the person behind the brand is still passionate about what they do or not. The truth eventually reveals itself.

## So what happened?

Well, the day came when I ran out of content and I stopped posting.

Some likes and comments still rolled in on my older viral posts but I didn't care.

I had multiple ideas and a couple of attempts for reviving it. I even rebranded it to my name thinking I could use that as a platform to build my own personal brand.

But my gut told me no. I didn’t want to do a bait and switch. If I was going to build my personal brand, I’ll do it right.

So I deleted the page. Not deactivated. Deleted.

## Why did I delete the page?

It was a heavy decision to make. This was my first venture into building something that got traction.

Ultimately, the thought of trying to revive a dead brand was consuming me so much that I couldn't make progress on starting new things.

I had the itch to create content again and the brand was holding me back because I kept thinking about how I could build on top of it, even though it wasn't a good fit.

The deciding factor was to grow by simplifying.

## Was it worth it?

It wasn't all a loss because I learned A LOT.

This made me a self-taught marketer and landed me a marketing internship role at Camp Krem, a camp for children and adults with developmental disabilities.

There I put my skills to a greater cause by documenting and telling the stories of the campers to a broader audience on Instagram.

Hustle Grind Empire opened one door, which led to another door, and another, and another. These doors would’ve stayed closed had I not decided to jump with both feet in.

## What I would have done differently

I think the younger me would’ve said that I wouldn't change a thing because that's how I got to where I am now. But that's partially the truth.

Of course, I would’ve loved to keep growing that brand and figure out a way to scale its impact.

What I would do differently is be real with my followers.

Tell them that I started with a foolish goal of 10k followers which I hit and that I still had a ton of content.

I would’ve talked to them. Get feedback on how they heard about the brand, what they liked about it, and what else they'd like to see.

It wasn’t clear to me back then, but it’s clear now. Talking to your customers and understanding them is so incredibly valuable.

## What I learned

I learned that I love to create. That I love to tell stories. That I love to understand who the people are that resonate with the stories you tell and why.

I remember staying up until 2 or 3 am engaging with the people who followed me and liked my content. I’d check out their profiles to see who they were and leave comments on their posts. Sometimes even direct messaging them to start a conversation.

I learned that the brand that connects with their fans in the most human and personal way wins. People trust brands who they feel an emotional connection to.

## What now?

That brings us to today.

I have a blank canvas ahead of me and can create whatever my heart yearns for — a part of that is this thing you’re reading.

I'm sitting at a Panera by myself at 7:20 pm on a Saturday because I love everything about this process.

I love to create imperfect work and keep moving forward.
