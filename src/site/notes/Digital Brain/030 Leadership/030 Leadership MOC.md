Leadership to me is a contradicting word. I don't think a leader stands on the high ground, hands on their hips, puffing their chest out, and proclaims "I am a leader".

I define a leader as someone who has the ability to stand on the high ground, middle ground, and sometimes lower ground. 

It's the assertiveness to be able to lead from the front that people *want* to follow. The flexibility to lead from the side as a colleague and ally. Most importantly, the humility to lead from behind as a mentor who trusts and believes in you.
