I think these notes are from a course on LinkedIn. Growing up poor, I definitely leaned more towards convergent thinking. My personal life has always been how do I get the most with less? and this trickled down to business. Unfortunately, that doesn't always work out when you're trying to reach hypergrowth with a company. I've been lucky enough to know the difference between these types of thinking and am self-aware to start with the endless possibilities first. 

It costs $0 to think of creative ideas, but it can cost the entire business if you limit creative thinking.

Start with divergent. Aim to balance the types of thinking

Divergent thinking
* Generating ideas in an open-minded and free-flowing manner
* Removing budget, capacity, and personnel, what wild ideas do we have?
* Ideas that will change the world, high-risk and high reward
* Encourages, "this could be done if..."

Convergent thinking
* Pragmatic approach
* Evaluate what's easy, probably, and doable
* Low-risk
* **Dangerous because it stops ideas before it begins, but it conserves capital**

First principles thinking
- Addition by subtraction.
- Questioning all assumptions in a product or system until you're left with the fundamental components
- Let go of everything except for essentials
- Turn tactical questions into strategical questions
	- What is this tactic for?
	- What is it here to achieve?

- Example: elon musk stripping rocket launches down to the laws of gravity and the materials needed to launch rockets

Breakthroughs come from unorthodox areas
- What other industry has faced this problem?
- What unrelated fields can I borrow inspiration from?
