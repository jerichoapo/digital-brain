I don't remember where I got these notes from. I think it was from a podcast. I can't say I agree with all of it, especially the "Why" part because this note makes it seem like being an Exec is a job title to strive for rather than a result of your actions. I write about job titles here: [[Digital Brain/080 Journal/When taking a step back is the right move forward\|When taking a step back is the right move forward]]. Regardless, there are some tidbits of good information.

Why be an exec?
- You like people
- You like big picture things

An exec's role changes based on the company's level
- Regardless, they care about how your team and other team's actions leads to revenue

Be a great human
- 80% of the role is about people and relationships
- Discipline: gym at X am
- Kindness: treating the security guard the same way you'd treat the building owner
- Learning: strive for improvement not for the end results but for the practice of improvement

You can't know it all, you don't want to be the smartest and most technical person

How can you expect above average results you must have above average habits 
- Discipline
- Self-improvement

Treat yourself like a project
- Learn in public
- You can't lead others until you lead yourself

Becoming an exec:
- Think and speak like you already are
