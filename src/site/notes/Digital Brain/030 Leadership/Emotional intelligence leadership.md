In the world of business, where you work with other people I think EQ>IQ.

Academically gifted people change the world and they move damn fast. But to move far, you need other people on your side. You alone are not scalable, you only have 24 hours in a day. But have another person on your team and you double your capacity.

It starts with having the self-awareness to understand that although EQ can be natural, it can also be learned. These are the four pillars of being a high EQ leader

1.) Self-awareness
- The most essential EQ variable
- Ability to read y our own emotions
- Know your strengths / limitations
- Gauge your own moods accurately and intuitively know how they are affecting others

2.) Self-management
- Ability to control your emotions and act with honesty and integrity
- Don't let occasional bad moods seize the day
- Use self-management to leave it outside the office or explain its source to people in a reasonable manner so they know where it's coming from and how long it'll last

3.) Social awareness
- Key capabilities of empathy and organizational intuition
- Does more than sense other people's emotions, they show that they care
- Experts at reading the current office politics
- Understand how their words and actions make others feel
- Sensitive enough to change their words when the impact is negative
  
4.) Relationship management
- Ability to communicate clearly and convincingly, disarm conflict, and build strong personal bonds
- Use these skills to spread enthusiasm and solve disagreements often with humor and kindness
